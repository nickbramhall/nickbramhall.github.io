  <div class="entry-content"><p>Beinn Eighe apparently means File Mountain, but to call it just a mountain doesn't seem to quite do it justice. It's a massive, sprawling massif that occupies a good proportion of the land between Loch Maree and Upper Loch Torridon. With its cap of quartzite it has a particularly distinct, almost Pyranean look about it, particularly once you breach the defenses and get inside the huge central coire.</p>

Distance: 13.4km<br>
Ascent:  1,401m<br>
Time: 6 hours 40 mins<br>
Hills: Stob Coire Sgreamach (Munro, 1,072m), Bidean nam Bian (Munro, 1,150m)<br>
Weather: Early sunshine giving way to cloudy summits. Clearing later in the day.</strong></p>
<p>It was a misty morning deep in the Carske but as we climbed out of Callendar and up to the shores of Loch Loraig already it was looking much more promising. The higher peaks maintained a covering of cloud but the valley roads were enjoying early morning sunshine. The journey was spectacular, leading eventually up onto the barren expanse of Rannoch Moor and then, after passing the King’s House and the Glencoe Ski Centre, the enigmatic sight of the big Buchaile marking the entrance to Glen Coe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For once I was actually at the rendezvous point before Dave, who in turn arrived a fair amount of time before the driver of our bus out to Braemar. Despite leaving Aberdeen slightly late we made good time along the quiet North Deeside road and after dropping off the lady with the lamp in Ballater were soon looking out for our stop just before the Inver Hotel. For anyone attempting to do this the best thing to look out for is the large green sign on the south side the road advertising the hotel ahead. Leave the bus here and backtrack a short distance to where a green Scottish Right of Way sign is located on the north side.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After heading to the West Coast and returning without a single additional Munro to my name last week (see this post on the spectacular Kinlochewe to Poolewe walk) I was ready to get out of Aberdeen and get up some hills a bit closer to home. Inspired by <a href="http://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/glensheeroute.html">Steven Fallon's suggested route</a> I chose the mountains east of Glenshee as my destination, the idea being to bag six of them before heading back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For any keen hillwalker Friday in Aberdeen was not a day to be looking out of the window. Passing thunderstorms, and the occasional shower of monsoon-like proportions turned the city into a grey, swirling, sodden mess. The Met Office reported conditions were not much better on the West Coast, and I didn’t even dare click on the scary-looking link marked “Latest Weather Warnings”. Still, Scotland is nothing if not surprising and by 10pm when I had crossed Aberdeen to the Atholl Hotel on King's Gate, the evening had become placid; clear, deep blue skies thanks to the rapidly vanishing clouds and a hint of summer in the air. The people milling around the Atholl supported this with short-sleeved shirts and linen dresses indicating a certain amount of optimism.</p>

Taking the 7:45am 201 we headed west as far as Crathie, the starting point for a very pleasant walk around the Balmoral estate under strong June sunshine.</p>

<p>Aberdeen was shrouded in cloud as we headed down the A90 on the first stage of the journey to Skye. A subsequent damp stop in Dunkeld (where we stumbled upon a flower show in the Cathedral) was followed by a drive up the busy A9 between mountains that became increasingly higher and wilder.</p>

<p>Under leaden skies nineteen brave walkers of the hills (including a good number of guests) were deposited at Keiloch, just short of Braemar, for a short stroll over (or around) Ben Avon (or A’an to confuse any visiting Trossachers).</p>
<p>After passing Invercauld house the group split (deliberately), with the majority heading towards the high plateau and summit of Ben Avon. The others chose a lower, slightly shorter route which would eventually get them to the Allargue Arms an hour before those who would brave the heights.</p>
