Distance: 13.4km<br>
Ascent:  1,401m<br>
Time: 6 hours 40 mins<br>
Hills: Stob Coire Sgreamach (Munro, 1,072m), Bidean nam Bian (Munro, 1,150m)<br>
Weather: Early sunshine giving way to cloudy summits. Clearing later in the day.</strong></p>
<p>It was a misty morning deep in the Carske but as we climbed out of Callendar and up to the shores of Loch Loraig already it was looking much more promising. The higher peaks maintained a covering of cloud but the valley roads were enjoying early morning sunshine. The journey was spectacular, leading eventually up onto the barren expanse of Rannoch Moor and then, after passing the King’s House and the Glencoe Ski Centre, the enigmatic sight of the big Buchaile marking the entrance to Glen Coe.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For once I was actually at the rendezvous point before Dave, who in turn arrived a fair amount of time before the driver of our bus out to Braemar. Despite leaving Aberdeen slightly late we made good time along the quiet North Deeside road and after dropping off the lady with the lamp in Ballater were soon looking out for our stop just before the Inver Hotel. For anyone attempting to do this the best thing to look out for is the large green sign on the south side the road advertising the hotel ahead. Leave the bus here and backtrack a short distance to where a green Scottish Right of Way sign is located on the north side.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After heading to the West Coast and returning without a single additional Munro to my name last week (see this post on the spectacular Kinlochewe to Poolewe walk) I was ready to get out of Aberdeen and get up some hills a bit closer to home. Inspired by <a href="http://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/glensheeroute.html">Steven Fallon's suggested route</a> I chose the mountains east of Glenshee as my destination, the idea being to bag six of them before heading back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For any keen hillwalker Friday in Aberdeen was not a day to be looking out of the window. Passing thunderstorms, and the occasional shower of monsoon-like proportions turned the city into a grey, swirling, sodden mess. The Met Office reported conditions were not much better on the West Coast, and I didn’t even dare click on the scary-looking link marked “Latest Weather Warnings”. Still, Scotland is nothing if not surprising and by 10pm when I had crossed Aberdeen to the Atholl Hotel on King's Gate, the evening had become placid; clear, deep blue skies thanks to the rapidly vanishing clouds and a hint of summer in the air. The people milling around the Atholl supported this with short-sleeved shirts and linen dresses indicating a certain amount of optimism.</p>

<p>Aberdeen was shrouded in cloud as we headed down the A90 on the first stage of the journey to Skye. A subsequent damp stop in Dunkeld (where we stumbled upon a flower show in the Cathedral) was followed by a drive up the busy A9 between mountains that became increasingly higher and wilder.</p>

<p>Under leaden skies nineteen brave walkers of the hills (including a good number of guests) were deposited at Keiloch, just short of Braemar, for a short stroll over (or around) Ben Avon (or A’an to confuse any visiting Trossachers).</p>
<p>After passing Invercauld house the group split (deliberately), with the majority heading towards the high plateau and summit of Ben Avon. The others chose a lower, slightly shorter route which would eventually get them to the Allargue Arms an hour before those who would brave the heights.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the third time in four weeks Lochnagar featured on my trek through the hills of Scotland. This time it was to be a relatively short hike from the car park, to the summit of the mountain and then down via Glas Allt to Glas-Allt-Shiel on the banks of Loch Muick. Starting at the car park we had a very pleasant walk across the broad valley of Glen Muick and through the woods to the start of the climb to the col below Meikle Pap. Although the sun wasn't exactly shining it was pleasantly warm, particularly sheltered from the strong breeze we could see blowing across the tops. Compared to three weeks ago the snow had melted significantly with patches remaining on higher ground or in the shadowy hollows of the burnside. As we got higher it became clear that low cloud was troubling the summit of Lochnagar, and as we left the main estate track to walk up the climb the wind suddenly hit us, buffeting strongly against our backs as we gained height. As we neared our first view of the cliffs a guy came down followed by his two young sons. We felt heartned by this s we came over the first rise and saw the dramatic cliffs rising in front of us, cradling the dark waters of the lochan, spray whipping across it in the wind.</p>

Time: 8 hours<br>

<p>Yesterday was only going to be a moderately ambitious day, with one or possibly two Munros climbed from Braemar. However in the end I did an epic traverse of the Mounth, adding Lochnagar to my journey and exiting several miles from Braemar at Crathie.</p>
<p>Catching the 07:45 Stagecoach from Aberdeen I was heading down the A93 towards the Glenshee Ski Centre a little before 10 am this morning. Retracing my steps from the day up Carn An Tuirc last month I left the A93 and headed down the beautiful, wild Glen Callater, stopping about an hour into the walk by the shores of Loch Callater. The weather was so far on my side, with sunny spells between clouds which were blowing gently through on an easterly breeze. It wasn't exactly warm but I certainly didn't need the extra layers that were required last week on the climb of Lochnagar.</p>
