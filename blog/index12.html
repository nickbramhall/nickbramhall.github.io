  <div class="entry-content"><p><em><strong>Overview:</strong> Anquet for Mac is a decent solution for route planning and mapping on a Mac. Its basic functionality is good and its maps are competitively priced with no initial outlay for the software itself. However, a lack of more advanced features and some usability issues means I’ll be keeping an eye on the opposition, including Routebuddy 3 which launches next month.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.vpmaps.com/anquet-maps/features">Anquet for Mac</a> was launched back in July 2010, joining <a href="http://www.routebuddy.com/">Routebuddy</a> as the second native mapping application for the Mac. I've been using it now for around eight months, for both plotting routes and printing maps for use on my trips, and have been generally pleased with the software. With the news over on Andy Howell’s blog that <a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2011/06/06/routebuddy-3-a-glimpse-of-the-future/">Routebuddy is almost ready to release version 3</a> of their software for the Mac, I thought I would take this opportunity to review my experiences so far with Anquet for Mac.</p>

<p>Cresting the brow of the steep final descent it was a great relief to see the car parked next to the sheep pen at Strathanmore, a small hamlet deep in picturesque Strathconon. The final rain shower had proved to be the worst, drenching us from head to foot as we waded our way through boggy peat and new burns that were springing into life more and more quickly. Back at the car it was a joy to be able to peel off soaked trousers, socks and shoes and change into dry clothes. My Montane eVent Jacket had stayed completely waterproof and so my top half was dry. It had taken us just six hours to do a quick round of a couple of Corbetts in a conditions that gave us everything from sunshine, to high winds, snow and stinging hail.</p>

I've now added links to the reports and blogs produced by each of the Challengers I highlighted in my original post. They are all definitely worth a read.</strong></p>
<p>The annual <a href="http://www.tgochallenge.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/">TGO Challenge</a> kicks off this weekend with several people already on the move from various starting points on the west coast of Scotland. This post is really just a collection of links to various people taking part and I'll try and keep it updated as I spot others. Please leave a comment with any other Challengers you know about (or if you are a Challenger!) and I'll add in the information. Finally, good luck to everyone taking part this year.</p>

<p>Bacon rolls from Ballater cheered us up a little but it was really the scraps of blue sky that could be glimpsed above the foothills of the Cairngorms that put a proper smile on our faces. The drive to the Linn of Dee had been through rain and ominous skies and although there was a little drizzle falling as we wended our way through the woods, by the time our feet were pounding out the kilometres of the Derry Road it had stopped and the air was muggy and warm.</p>

<p>I had an ambitious plan, but it was drawn out such that I also had a means of escape if things were too tough. So it was that on Saturday at midday, rather than heading up towards The Saddle, I found myself riding the City Link bus back up from Shiel Bridge. Twenty-four hours earlier I’d left the car near the Clunie Inn and set off to do a full circuit of Glen Shiel. The first half of the route would be a complete traverse of the North Shiel Ridge, a fabulous ridge walk that combines the Three Brothers and the famous Five Sisters of Kintail to give roughly 11 miles of delightful high-level walking, with barely a dip below 850m along the entire length.</p>

<p>The intensifying sunlight drew me from my slumbers and as the brightness
filled the tent I could begin to see the frost glittering on the outside
of the fly. Above me beaded a few drops of condensation on the inner but
this was no great surprise given the calmness of the night.</p>

<p>Saturday evening. The sun has slunk below the horizon, ashamed of its lack of show. Clouds drift lazily through a dark sky. Somewhere near the tent a snuffling is heard, a deer or sheep tugging gently at the tussocky grass I'm camped on. By the time I look out it has gone. Back inside, I draw the sleeping bag tight around my face and lay back, listening to the burn murmuring gently to my right. Life is good.</p>

<p>Glen Clova seems to be the perfect destination for an afternoon walk. I climbed Mayar and Dreish late one May evening and on Sunday chose to use a free and unexpectedly sunny afternoon to visit the summit of The Goet/Ben Tirran, a 798m high Corbett on the north side of the glen.</p>

<p>My approaching footsteps sent the sheep skittering away across the tussocky flats next to the river. They stopped some distance away bleating balefully and watching me pass by. Their flight had taken them in amongst the scattered stones of a long abandoned shieling, one of many that can be seen along the length of this overlooked glen. I was deep in the heart of Glen Dye, away from the people puffing and panting their way up Clachnaben, and enjoying the solitude and scenery in this pleasant little corner of the world.</p>
