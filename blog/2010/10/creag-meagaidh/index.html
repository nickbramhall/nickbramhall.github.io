<p>Autumn has definitely been making its presence felt in the east of
Scotland with wind and rain blowing through constantly during the past
week. Meanwhile, over in the west there had been reports of high
pressure and clear, though windy, conditions. With a good forecast for
Sunday (and after missing my alarm on Saturday) I was up early and
speeding across towards the west.</p>


<p>The MWIS forecast suggested there would be a weather split around the
line of the A9, so today I chose to do a circuit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creag_Meagaidh">Creag
Meagaidh</a> which lies to the
north of the road between Aviemore and Spean Bridge. There were high
winds forecast and so I chose to do the round in an anti-clockwise
direction, keeping the easterly wind to my back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072214647/"><img alt="Welcome Sign" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4105/5072214647_f9d17dbba5_b.jpg" title="Welcome Sign"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072838278/"><img alt="Autumn in the Highlands" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4105/5072838278_4733def316_b.jpg" title="Autumn in the Highlands"></a></p>
<p>At the large public car park at Aberarder which I arrived at just after
10am, there was definitely a strong wind blowing and it felt cold. This
was despite the best efforts of the sun which was starting to break out
through the fast moving clouds. Looking at the conditions I decided to
take the winter jacket and was later very glad of it.</p>
<p>The jacket wasn’t needed at first though. Once kitted up I set off up
the well built track which passes the large house and then winds its way
gently up, passing through sparse woodland; the russets and golds on
display in the glen here were beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072279877/"><img alt="The climb up from Loch Laggan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4085/5072279877_5325f82268_b.jpg" title="The climb up from Loch Laggan"></a></p>
<p>At a small cairn I took a smaller track which branched off uphill and to
the right. This track was reasonably good to begin with as it climbed up
through the trees, but rapidly descended into a boggy ribbon as the
vegetation thinned.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072338339/"><img alt="Climbing above Loch Laggan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4130/5072338339_51bdc918fa_b.jpg" title="Climbing above Loch Laggan"></a></p>
<p>Luckily the views that were starting to open out, both ahead and behind,
were sufficient to take my mind off the undesirable conditions
underfoot. Behind me rays of sunlight were bursting out of thinning
cloud to touch the waters of Loch Laggan, whilst to my left I could see
deeper into Coire Ardair, the great Coire around which the peaks of
Creag Meagaidh sit watchfully.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072890254/"><img alt="Light over Laggan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4125/5072890254_c7b5c5a101_b.jpg" title="Light over Laggan"></a></p>
<p>Just below the low summit of Cnap Cnapanan, the bog finally relented and
the path became excellent. This relatively low jumble of crags was
bypassed around its north side, giving excellent views down Loch Laggan,
and then the final push up Carn Liath began. The track continued until
the final summit boulder field where it was lost amongst the hard,
featureless ground.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072355557/"><img alt="Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4150/5072355557_8141147607_b.jpg" title="Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I had climbed I had entered into the cloud which was
stubbornly sitting at around 975m. It was being whipped up by the strong
easterly wind that now hit me with its full force as I staggered east,
making my way from one cairn to the next until I came to the big cairn
marking the summit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073013366/"><img alt="Summit of Carn Liath" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4091/5073013366_a77f0c2586_b.jpg" title="Summit of Carn Liath"></a></p>
<p>I was very glad of the windbreak in the lee side of the cairn and sat
down to have a brew and a snack. Away north, towards Garva bridge and
the glen containing the young Spey, there was blue sky beginning to
break through.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073027264/"><img alt="A change in the weather" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4103/5073027264_987c6bf060_b.jpg" title="A change in the weather"></a></p>
<p>Over the course of ten minutes the views improved dramatically and by
the time I had stopped to have a look at the “gate to nowhere” and then
returned past the cairn to pick up the main track west, there was
definite signs of an improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073021282/"><img alt="A gate to nowhere" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4153/5073021282_aa56c7a167_b.jpg" title="A gate to nowhere"></a></p>
<p>Carrying on down from the summit of Carn Liath I was soon bathed in
sunshine. Sheltered from the wind by the bulk of Carn Liath it was
wonderfully warm, swiftly bringing life back to my cold fingers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072469253/"><img alt="First view of the Window" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4087/5072469253_a6b9f9192c_b.jpg" title="First view of the Window"></a></p>
<p>From Carn Liath to the next Munro, Stob Poite Coire Ardair, there is a
gentle rolling walk along an undulating ridge that takes in a number of
smaller summits. As I advanced along it the views continued to improve,
the cloud being teased away from the summits in front of me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072481107/"><img alt="Loch Laggan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4103/5072481107_1a6164b2c7_b.jpg" title="Loch Laggan"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073134156/"><img alt="On the north ridge of Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4112/5073134156_1703042348_b.jpg" title="On the north ridge of Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073142106/"><img alt="Looking north over the upper Spey" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4144/5073142106_924eed02b4_b.jpg" title="Looking north over the upper Spey"></a></p>
<p>The track led along the crest of the ridge and here I once again
encountered the wind which was now thankfully (or else because of my
excellent route planning!) behind me. I paused often to peer down into
the coire and take photos looking along towards the cliffs. In the
distance I could now see the fabled Window, the one weakness in Coire
Ardair’s otherwise impenetrable defences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072469253/"><img alt="First view of the Window" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4087/5072469253_a6b9f9192c_b.jpg" title="First view of the Window"></a></p>
<p>Finally after crossing a subsidiary top the ridge curves around to the
left up to the second Munro of the day, Stob Poite Coire Ardair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073192058/"><img alt="The ridge leading to Stob Poite Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4131/5073192058_c975bb350f_b.jpg" title="The ridge leading to Stob Poite Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072605735/"><img alt="Light hitting the floor of Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4104/5072605735_617c6d9d5a_b.jpg" title="Light hitting the floor of Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p>From the approach to the east this is a shapely mountain with riven
gulleys in its facing side. Once you are on top though it is a fairly
flat plateau which runs some distance towards the west end where the
summit cairn is to be found. Luckily, though the terrain lacked
interest, the views down into Coire Ardair were spectacular. Each time I
went over to have a look the lighting had changed, breaks in the cloud
sending rays down to hit the valley floor and push rippling patterns
across the hidden lochan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5071860119/"><img alt="A magical moment" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4130/5071860119_3e84d9be04_b.jpg" title="A magical moment"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073442272/"><img alt="Coire Ardair illuminated" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4124/5073442272_fafc7fee5d_b.jpg" title="Coire Ardair illuminated"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073434358/"><img alt="Looking back to Carn Liath" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4088/5073434358_d60a8d5a9b_b.jpg" title="Looking back to Carn Liath"></a></p>
<p>The views back to Carn Liath were also improving with the increasing
sunshine. Eventually I tore myself away to briefly visit the summit
cairn. It was so windy though that I barely spent more than a minute
there before heading off the west and dropping down on a good path to
the shelter of the Window, a wide col above the narrow defile which
drops rapidly down into Coire Ardair.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072829915/"><img alt="Coire Ardair and Loch Laggan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4126/5072829915_87c8a8b757_b.jpg" title="Coire Ardair and Loch Laggan"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072885165/"><img alt="Summit plateau of Stob Poite Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4124/5072885165_cf701d7e78_b.jpg" title="Summit plateau of Stob Poite Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5072873801/"><img alt="The Window and Craig Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4145/5072873801_7402f57c56_b.jpg" title="The Window and Craig Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p>The main plateau of Creag Meagaidh itself had by now cleared almost
entirely of cloud and as the final layer was peeled away the summit
could be seen, complete with a couple of tiny figures silhouetted
against the sun.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5073487344/"><img alt="Cloud clears from Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4110/5073487344_ec0cacb592_b.jpg" title="Cloud clears from Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5074489507/"><img alt="Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4008/5074489507_31a7e53c5e_b.jpg" title="Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>

<p>At the Window I paused to take advantage of the shelter offered by the
close set walls and in the sunshine enjoyed a lunch, looking away across
the wild and desolate hills that sit to the east of the Great Glen above
the infant waters of the Spey.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075107378/"><img alt="The Window" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4060/5075107378_b41252fca3_b.jpg" title="The Window"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5074512173/"><img alt="Admiring the view" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4063/5074512173_4ac6ee811f_b.jpg" title="Admiring the view"></a></p>
<p>As I was sitting contemplating the view, I noticed running up from the
far end of the nearby Lochan Uaine, what appeared to be a ridgeline that
rose neatly up to almost the summit of Creag Meagaidh. I got the map out
and studied the contours and found that it was a ramp-like corrie that
should make a good route up. Going this way would avoid me retracing my
steps as I had already made my mind up to descend by the Window and
visit Coire Ardair itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075113400/"><img alt="Approaching the Green Lochan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4018/5075113400_2a0e6cd10a_b.jpg" title="Approaching the Green Lochan"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5074517993/"><img alt="Small Lochan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4007/5074517993_e82719ba30_b.jpg" title="Small Lochan"></a></p>
<p>After lunch I packed up and left the baggers path which heads up the
slope to the south of the Window. I skirted along slightly bouldery and
boggy ground to the north of the Green Lochan. At the far end I found a
jumble of boulders that I climbed which brought me along a grass rake to
the foot of the corrie itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5074521477/"><img alt="The Green Lochan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4008/5074521477_c568d2de89_b.jpg" title="The Green Lochan"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5074527893/"><img alt="The coire" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4059/5074527893_2abc8b713a_b.jpg" title="The coire"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075135466/"><img alt="The Green Lochan" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4028/5075135466_864d03d0f9_b.jpg" title="The Green Lochan"></a></p>
<p>Almost immediately I found a faint track which led upwards. I lost it
occasionally amongst crags and rocks but then picked it up again higher
up. In almost no time I emerged on the plateau of Creag Meagaidh itself
with just the final pull up the summit to complete. I was there in
no-time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075141606/"><img alt="The final slope to the summit of Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4131/5075141606_f1f6f1dbee_b.jpg" title="The final slope to the summit of Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075147348/"><img alt="Summit of Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4063/5075147348_bf3cde69d1_b.jpg" title="Summit of Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p>The views from the summit were simply sublime. A haze pervaded the view
and thick clouds were rolling up against distant peaks. The quality of
light was almost surreal, the haze turning the sky grey on the horizon
but leaving it a clear and crystalline deep blue above. I moved slightly
away from the summit to sit and take in the views.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075874189/"><img alt="The Loch Treig Hills" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4044/5075874189_2960f71b32_b.jpg" title="The Loch Treig Hills"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076460198/"><img alt="Hills to the west" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4039/5076460198_9b89c36cea_b.jpg" title="Hills to the west"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076449390/"><img alt="The Easains and Grey Corries" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4104/5076449390_451efb8474_b.jpg" title="The Easains and Grey Corries"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076452258/"><img alt="On the summit of Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4052/5076452258_4121ca53ae_b.jpg" title="On the summit of Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p>After this I retreated back to the summit cairn to enjoy a final brew
whilst staying sheltered from the wind. Then it was back down the way
I’d come, but this time continuing across the plateau to take a look at
Mad Meg’s Cairn, a huge structure below which was reportedly buried the
body of a young girl who committed suicide but was refused a burial in
the local kirkyard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075883885/"><img alt="Mad Meg's cairn" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4019/5075883885_39940cc3c9_b.jpg" title="Mad Meg's cairn"></a></p>

<p>After this I headed eastwards to peer over the edge of the cliffs into
Coire Ardair itself. The view from this end was very dramatic with the
late afternoon sunshine lighting the far side of the coire whilst the
lochan was lost in shadow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076488784/"><img alt="The cliffs above Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4067/5076488784_620a62d999_b.jpg" title="The cliffs above Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076497710/"><img alt="Looking into Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4002/5076497710_5273fd5f0c_b.jpg" title="Looking into Coire Ardair"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075907967/"><img alt="The north ridge of Creag Meagaidh" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4046/5075907967_4d28a2fd41_b.jpg" title="The north ridge of Creag Meagaidh"></a></p>
<p>From here I then followed the clear track back down to the Window. I
didn’t stay too long at the col but now took the path that dropped into
the Window itself.</p>
<p>From the col the initial descent is very steep down a cascade of
boulders which are damp and cold in their sheltered eastern position.
After some time of making only slow progress I finally reached a line of
grass that descended down the side of the boulders, a faint track
zig-zagging its way down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5075921185/"><img alt="The Window" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4019/5075921185_4d116337a9_b.jpg" title="The Window"></a></p>

<p>A final clamber across the bottom of the boulders got me onto a good
track that now made its way to the shores of the lochan. The views up
onto the cliffs were breathtaking. Slightly further down the coire two
stags were bellowing, their cries low and mournful but echoing strangely
off the rocks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5076533398/"><img alt="Puist Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4047/5076533398_ff2a3a73e4_b.jpg" title="Puist Coire Ardair"></a></p>

<p>I sat for a moment munching on a final bar of chocolate and looking over
the quiet waters of the lochan, the dark cliffs standing solemnly
behind. This is definitely a place I want to return to.</p>

<p>After this there was no problem with routefinding. An excellent track
runs the length of the coire, from the lochan back to Aberader. Once
away from the cliffs I was back in the golden afternoon sunshine and got
to enjoy a wonderfully peaceful walk back, breathing in the views.</p>

<p>Closer to Loch Laggan you pass through a few stands of beech trees and
these were stunning, illuminated by the sun. Unfortunately my SLR
battery died at this point so I was left with my phone camera to capture
them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5077208679/"><img alt="Trees in Coire Ardair" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4011/5077208679_2def84b786_b.jpg" title="Trees in Coire Ardair"></a></p>

<p>Eventually, around an hour or so after leaving the lochan I arrived back
at the car park, the sun starting to sink below the hills and a chill
creeping into the air.</p>
<p>After packing up and changing shoes I started the long drive back to
Aberdeen, pausing a couple of times initially to photograph the stunning
sunset.</p>

<p>It had been a great day with conditions improving all the time and the
consistent haze bringing a dramatic aspect to the light.</p></div>
