<p>Wrapped up in my down sleeping bag on my incredibly comfy air bed, itself resting on wonderfully soft mountain turf, I was at first very confused about where I was and what my alarm was doing going off at the uncivilised hour of 4am. Then it came back to me, I was camped just a short distance away from the summit of a Munro. A few minutes spent outside the tent around midnight had shown a clear sky which promised great things for the dawn. Reluctantly I unzipped my bag and sleepily dragged my clothes back on. Stifling a yawn I unzipped the inner of my tent and peered out. The pre-dawn sky was a deep indigo with bands of red cloud sitting just above the golden haze of the horizon. My legs were objecting to more physical exercise so soon after a twenty mile day but I cajoled them into action and we got up to the summit cairn of Beinn Eibhinn just in time to see the sun peek above the eastern hills. The quality and colour of the light was just staggering and I spent a happy half hour wandering around snapping photos and breathing in this utterly magical time of day. In a cruel season of wet and windy weather this was truly a summer morning to savour.</p>

<p>The bright skies of the night before had been a good portent and I awoke after a long, comfortable and slumbering sleep to find the tent lit up by the rising sun. I’d slept through sunrise but poked my head out in time to see the sun crest the notch of the Bealach Dubh. Warm and cosy, I was reluctant to get up but knew that I had a big day ahead. Outside the world was frosty, the grass sparkling with a million frozen crystal drops and the tent covered in a layer of thin ice. I got my stove going and soon had hot coffee and porridge which was a great way to start the day.</p>

<p>Ben Alder. A remote, sprawling mountain often discussed in hushed terms amongst Munro baggers. It’s a long way from anywhere and unless you are cycling in from Dalwhinnie a traverse usually requires an overnight stay in the bothy at Culra or taking a tent. I don’t have a bike and dislike the idea of staying in such a potentially busy bothy so for me it was going to be a camping trip. With the region home to anything from 2 to 14 Munros (depending on how widely you cast your net) there was plenty of potential for a big rambling route picking up a number of summits. After reading with interest the <a href="http://v-g.me.uk/blog/backpack-trip-reports/around-the-ben-alder-mountains-5-day-backpack/">recent report on V-G of a low level five day route</a> I modified my original plan and incorporated some of Geoff's elements, turning it into a high level three day route with the low level option there as a good FWA (foul weather alternative) should things turn south.</p>

<p>I ummed and ahhhed all day on Sunday over whether to head to the hills for a quick overnighter but eventually at just after 6pm I got moving and after adding a splash of petrol to the tank was heading down the A90 towards Brechin. Temperatures in Scotland have soared over the last week and whilst I was turned back by snow on the Strathfarrar Ridge just 8 days previous the car thermometer was now holding steady at 25C…. at 6:30pm.</p>

<p>The weekend weather forecast had been a constant tease. As the week progressed some days it said that Saturday was supposed to be best, other days it was to be Sunday. I set out anyway on Friday afternoon with sufficient food packed to last me a couple of days in the hills. I would just have to see what the conditions were like and take any fair weather opportunity that came along. I'd already noted a couple of foul weather alternatives if everything went south.</p>

<p>Sunlight dappled the forest track as we climbed away from the Linn of Dee. The long march down the Derry Road was completed without much complaint as the sight of the snow capped mountains under brilliant blue skies drew us on. A welcome elevenses broke the journey at Derry Lodge where we sat around in the sunshine though the breeze was cool enough to merit an outer layer and zipped up tops.</p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>The café in Achnasheen at lunchtime on Friday. Piping hot lentil and
vegetable soup followed by coffee and homemade cake. Outside sleet falls
from great grey clouds drifting over Strath Bran. I’m excited to be back
in the North West Highlands but a little nervous about the weather
forecast and how far my three season gear will be tested over the coming
couple of days. I’m also a little concerned about how much of a problem
the cold and flu I’m still suffering from will play a part in
proceedings.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m sure that many people know of, use and maybe even contribute to the <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">Geograph Britain and Ireland website</a>. The aim of the project is to “<em>collect geographically representative photographs and information for every square kilometre of Great Britain and Ireland</em>”. This very simple premise is producing an incredibly useful resource and I have found the Geograph site oftentimes as invaluable for trip planning as a topographical map or aerial photography. This post aims to introduce those of you who aren't familiar with it to the site and some ways you might find Geograph useful when planning trips.</p>

<p>Sunday morning, 6:45am. Most sensible, well-adjusted people were still in their beds, grumbling at the noise of ice being noisily chipped off a windscreen and the idling engine bringing some much needed warmth to a frozen car. I was off by 7, the streets of Aberdeen quiet but brightly lit by sunshine. It remained that way for the whole of the journey. The petrol station outside of Dundee still seemed to be catching up with deliveries but I did eventually find a working unleaded pump (are the retailers trying to force us into buying their “premium” stuff with all these continuing shenanigans?) and then it was a fun blast along the road past Loch Earn and over Glen Ogle to Crianlarich and my parking spot besides the A82 just short of Tyndrum.</p>

<p>The next time I awoke it was that still, cold hour before dawn. The skies were much hazier, the stars mostly veiled and some patchy cloud was drifting around the glen. I dozed off again, waking some time later when the quality of light had changed and the sun was almost up. Outside it was a beautiful dawn. A crisp, deep blue sky, dewy grass, and the mountains all around me. I made a cup of coffee and sat around, watching the colours change and the sun suddenly crest the eastern hills. It was a stunning sight.</p>
