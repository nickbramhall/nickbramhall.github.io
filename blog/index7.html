<p><strong>Date: 8th-9th June 2013<br>
Distance: 45.03km<br>
Ascent: 3,015m<br>
Hills: Beinn Eunaich [Munro], Beinn a' Chochuill [Munro], Ben Cruachan [Munro], Stob Daimh [Munro]  <br>
Weather: Glorious. Warm and sunny. Very little breeze except in the evening.   <br>
Route: <a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/254">View on OS Maps</a></strong></p>
<p>An inauspicious start: drizzly grey in Aberdeen; passing the aftermath of a bad accident on the A90; wiping out a pheasant on the A85 coming into Comrie. Thankfully by the time I wound down towards Loch Awe from Tyndrum the sun was shining and after a quick map check I found the layby near the farm of Castles which is the starting point for those heading towards the Lairig Noe and the two Munros to the north of this pass.</p>

<p>This is Part 2 of my TGO Challenge 2013 which picks up the story on Day 6 after an overnight stay and re-supply in Fort Augustus. If you missed it you can catch up on <a href="/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-1/">Part 1</a>, covering Days 1 to 5 of my 2013 TGO Challenge, at <a href="/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-1/">this link</a>.</p>
<h2>Route</h2>
<p>As a reminder here is my route as recorded by my Spot Messenger over the course of the Crossing. You can zoom in and scroll around to explore my actual track (in orange) and my planned route (in green).</p>

<h2>Day 6, Thursday 16th May</h2>
<p><strong>Route: Fort Augustus to Wild Camp below Geal Charn<br>
Distance: 30km (Total 135km)<br>
Hills: Meall na h-Aisre (Corbett), Geal Charn (Munro)</strong></p>
<p>Arriving in Fort Augustus the previous afternoon, I’d been keen to move on, and probably wouldn’t have minded just continuing on with the wild camping, especially in the face of so many coach parties. However, the comfortable sleep, hot shower and delicious cooked breakfast at Three Bridges really changed that. Feeling more than adequately fed, and both clean and rested, it was in high spirits that I set off from Fort Augustus into the morning sunshine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In May 2013 I backpacked across Scotland. This is part one of the trip report which covers the days from Plockton to Fort Augustus.</em></p>
<p>I suppose it all began last year when, one bright September afternoon, I crossed the sunny concourse of Aberdeen Railway Station and bought a copy of the October issue of <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/">TGO Magazine</a> from the newsagents. There towards the back was an application form which I dutifully filled in, laying out my recent experiences of wild camping and hillwalking in Scotland. I mailed it off and sat back, waiting hopefully like so many others for the thud of a heavy brown envelope signalling good news. In the meantime I took my big map of Scotland and started sketching out a couple of possible routes. I was already starting to dream of May 2013 and setting out on the 34th <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/tgochallenge/">TGO Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>Amazingly the 230g gas canister I set out with lasted up until coffee on the final morning. I had bought a 110g canister in Aviemore but it had sat unused in my pack until now. In retrospect I could have missed out on the final brew but as it was I fired up the stove on fresh fuel and enjoyed my final dose of caffeine. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>A look at the kit I’ll be taking with me on my coast-to-coast route across Scotland planned for May 2013</em></p>
<p>In less than a week I’ll be setting off from Plockton on <a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/04/tgoc-route/">my TGO Challenge</a>. Gear is of course a very personal thing and what I’ll be taking with me has, in most cases, proved itself over several trips over the last couple of years. There are a couple of new items but these got a reasonable <a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/">outing in Ardgour last weekend</a> and I’m confident that they’ll suit my needs. I was aiming for a baseweight of 8kg but have slightly overshot, mainly because of the addition of a pair of microspikes to deal with whatever remains of winter in the high mountains. This also details food required for the first stretch which is 4.5 days of walking to get me to Fort Augustus. Subsequent sections are shorter but I’ll be carrying store bought foods.</p>

<p>With just two weeks left until the start of the TGO Challenge I decided it was about time I got out and did some backpacking. Recent weekends have been taken up by a number of interesting diversions with trips to see family in Yorkshire at Easter, a few nights in London followed by a wedding in Norfolk and then taking visitors around the delights of Royal Deeside. All of this amounted to a lot of good food, drink and travel, but very little hiking and certainly no nights spent cooped up in a tent listening to the Scottish rain hammering down.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/tgochallenge/about-the-challenge/">TGO Challenge</a> was first held in 1980 (the brain-child of Hamish Brown) and is now one of the largest annual organised backpacking events in the world. Come the middle of May around 300 folk will set off to cross Scotland from west to east by whatever route they choose over the course of around two weeks. </p>
<p>I originally applied back in October but didn’t receive a confirmed place. I was put on the standby list and happily gained a place on this year’s Challenge at the beginning of March. </p>

<p>A couple of years ago Fraser put up <a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/loch-an-daimh-overnighter/">his report of a weekend trip around Loch an Daimh</a> in Highland Perthshire and I immediately added the round to my to-do list. From this initial idea I spread out the map and picked out a slightly extended route that, rather than dropping to the end of the loch to camp as Fraser had, stayed high so that the addition of the two Corbetts was possible without much loss of height. I had a few vague ideas for camp spots but decided to see how far I got on the day and then make a final decision as to whether to camp higher up or find a more sheltered spot lower down.</p>

<p>I have no qualms about labelling myself as a fair-weather hiker, and perhaps even more so, a fair-weather backpacker. The thought of a spending a restless night in a tent being thrown about by gusting winds or lashed by rain really doesn’t appeal. And so it was that several weekends in January and February were dismissed for one weather-related reason or another. Eventually though there was a hint of something better in the forecast, with milder temperatures and gentler winds promised I packed up my camping gear and headed for the Cairngorms. With just an afternoon and a morning available I chose a straightforward circular route from Keiloch on the A93 a few miles east of Braemar. An overnight camp would break up the 18 miles quite nicely and would give me an opportunity to try some mild winter camping. </p>
