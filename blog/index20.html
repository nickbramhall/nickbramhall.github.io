  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went on my second outing with the Stocket Hillwalking Club. The day started at 8am with quite a squeeze onto a tiny bus with 26 other keen walkers. We had a somewhat bumpy ride out south and west of Aberdeen to the remote Glen Esk where after a cry of "stop!" from most of the bus we were dropped off in the tiny hamlet of Tarfside at the southern end of The Fungle Road.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the forecast promising everything from clear skies right through to blizzards and howling winds I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I set out for Braemar this morning. In the end I got a later bus as the winds were ferocious at 6:30am in Aberdeen and this seemed to be a good move as it was sunny and relatively clear as we headed west up Deeside. Of course it didn't last and by the time the bus pulled into Braemar the skies were steel-grey and a steady stream of sleety snow was falling from them. Not wanting to waste a 2 hour bus ride I stocked up on Cadbury's Fruit &amp; Nut bars before heading out of the village and south down the A93.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning saw me over on the other side of Aberdeen at just after 7am to find the meeting point of the <a href="http://www.stockets.org.uk/">Stocket Hillwalking Club</a>. After wandering the streets before enquiring at the local newsagent (and stocking up on Dairy Milk Fruit &amp; Nut bars) as to the whereabouts of Mile End School, I turned a corner and found a hillwalker waiting in a likely spot. So it was that just after 8am we were heading out of town on a warm coach, bound for Deecastle, just beyond Dinnet on the south side of the River Dee.</p>

<p>I went walking today with a friend from work. After a slight problem with a closed road and diversion, we got to the car park at Glen Dye by 10 this morning. Under slightly hazy skies but ridiculously mild air we crossed into Miller's Bog, walking along a good forest track. From there we turned north, following a landrover track up and around Greystane Hill which has been planted with new conifer trees in recent years. As we approached the top a young deer sprang across the road and moved up the hill, turning to watch us with unwavering eyes for a couple of minutes before turning and moving off. The track eventually peetered out in a boggy patch of land where a small burn came off the lower slopes of Mount Shade. We headed up the firmer ground along its bank before coming to a deer fence. Instead of following it west towards our target we gained some height and crossed it at a point higher up where another clear track wound its way along a line of the hills. This gave us some stunning views over Miller's Bog, southward to the Howe of the Mearns and eventually brought the Granite-plugged peak of Clachnaben into view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was supposed to be going offshore for the very first time this weekend but due to an unfortunate few days of rain, high winds and general unpleasantness our flight got knocked back a week. Instead the true irony of the British weather was found when it turned out that Saturday was to be a perfect winter's day: cold, crisp and clear. </p>
