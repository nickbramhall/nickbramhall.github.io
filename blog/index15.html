<p>Autumn has definitely been making its presence felt in the east of
Scotland with wind and rain blowing through constantly during the past
week. Meanwhile, over in the west there had been reports of high
pressure and clear, though windy, conditions. With a good forecast for
Sunday (and after missing my alarm on Saturday) I was up early and
speeding across towards the west.</p>

<p>With twenty-one Stockets aboard the bus (after pick-ups at the Bridge of Dee and at Stonehaven) we made our way down the A90 to Glen Clova. Initial sunshine in Aberdeenshire soon gave way to less pleasant conditions into Angus with dark clouds sitting ominously over the hills and glens. After a break at Stracathro services we made our way through Kirriemuir and then out onto the narrow road to Clova. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Looking back at my camping trip last weekend I've been checking out my weights and kit list to see how things worked out, what will be in the bag next time, what can be left behind and what I have still to purchase. My total base weight before adding food and water was just over 7kg. In total (though I didn't weigh my full bag with food and water) I estimate that I carried in just under 8kg from the Linn of Dee. Looking at my GPS report this weight doesn't seem to have hampered my level(ish) trail pace very much, although going uphill was a different matter. Still, it definitely wasn't debilitating and I was able to cover 15 miles carrying the heavy bag which I am pleased with.</p>

<p>At half-past six in the evening and with a boot full of gear I headed out of Aberdeen towards the sunny west. There were clouds about but the sun was shining and the air was warm as I drove through Braemar and out along the road to the Linn of Dee. The sunshine over the Dee was beautiful.</p>

<p>The day did not start well. I slept through my alarm and woke up at 7am with the wind blowing a hoolie outside and the cloud low and ominous over the grey city of Aberdeen. My hand left the warm comfort of the duvet only long enough to pick my laptop up. From under the covers I re-read the MWIS report for the North-West Highlands and watched the BBC Scotland weather report. Had last night's reading of the same information been a dream? Would I really find the sun if I headed for the western hills? Well, apparently I would! The report still insisted there was an 80% chance of cloud free Munros and visibility improving over the course of the day.</p>

<p>I had a late start today but the forecast was good and with the summer well on its way daylight was never going to be an issue. I started walking at 11:20 from the excellent walkers car park at Dalrigh. I dropped down to the West Highland Way and followed this as it passes the farm buildings. It was lovely walking, with the sun occasionally coming out, a slight breeze keeping the midges away, and a good clear track to the follow. As the WHW turned away to Tyndrum I continued on the landrover track that left the woods and continued west along the course of the Cononish.</p>

<p>There is nothing better than having a mere ten mile drive to get to the start of a walk, but the icing on this particular cake was that these particular ten miles were done in sunshine and with the stunning scenery on either side of Loch Leven to admire. From the hostel at Inchree it was only a twenty minute drive along the northern shore of the loch to the turning for Mamore Lodge. I drove carefully up the single track access road to the Lodge, arriving just after 8am where the only person awake to take my £3 parking fee was the housekeeper. It was a beautiful morning but I set off quickly as the midgies were already out in force and not being particularly friendly.</p>
