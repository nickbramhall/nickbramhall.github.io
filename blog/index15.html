<p>At half-past six in the evening and with a boot full of gear I headed out of Aberdeen towards the sunny west. There were clouds about but the sun was shining and the air was warm as I drove through Braemar and out along the road to the Linn of Dee. The sunshine over the Dee was beautiful.</p>

<p>The day did not start well. I slept through my alarm and woke up at 7am with the wind blowing a hoolie outside and the cloud low and ominous over the grey city of Aberdeen. My hand left the warm comfort of the duvet only long enough to pick my laptop up. From under the covers I re-read the MWIS report for the North-West Highlands and watched the BBC Scotland weather report. Had last night's reading of the same information been a dream? Would I really find the sun if I headed for the western hills? Well, apparently I would! The report still insisted there was an 80% chance of cloud free Munros and visibility improving over the course of the day.</p>

<p>I had a late start today but the forecast was good and with the summer well on its way daylight was never going to be an issue. I started walking at 11:20 from the excellent walkers car park at Dalrigh. I dropped down to the West Highland Way and followed this as it passes the farm buildings. It was lovely walking, with the sun occasionally coming out, a slight breeze keeping the midges away, and a good clear track to the follow. As the WHW turned away to Tyndrum I continued on the landrover track that left the woods and continued west along the course of the Cononish.</p>

<p>There is nothing better than having a mere ten mile drive to get to the start of a walk, but the icing on this particular cake was that these particular ten miles were done in sunshine and with the stunning scenery on either side of Loch Leven to admire. From the hostel at Inchree it was only a twenty minute drive along the northern shore of the loch to the turning for Mamore Lodge. I drove carefully up the single track access road to the Lodge, arriving just after 8am where the only person awake to take my £3 parking fee was the housekeeper. It was a beautiful morning but I set off quickly as the midgies were already out in force and not being particularly friendly.</p>

<p>A slightly later start than usual had me slightly concerned that I was missing out on the early weather window promised by MWIS and the Met Office. Although it was slightly overcast in Aberdeen at 6:30am, as I drove down the A90 the cloud retreated from the coast until it hung over the Angus hills, leaving me in bright sunshine. Dundee and Perth were only just waking up as I sailed through and it was only the usual combination of tractors, road works and weekend drivers that slowed me down on the A82. Loch Earn looked spectacular and after that it was short blast south towards Stirling before turning off the main road and making for Balquidda.</p>

<p>With MWIS promising brighter skies by early afternoon following a damp start I decided to use this as an excuse to make the long journey across country to Glen Spean in Lochaber. At Spean Bridge I turned off the main Fort William road and drove up the narrow road to Corriechoille. Beyond the farm the road is rough but didn't pose any problems for my Fiesta. I went through the first gate and then parked at the area just in front of the second locked gate.</p>

<p>It was a dawn of bright promise over Aberdeen as both members of the Stocket Hillwalking Club and the infamous Cairngorm Club gathered on Mid-Stocket Road for the first 7am start of the season. The preceding days had been warm and sunny and there was optimism for a day free of snow-wading. It didn't turn out quite that way, but certainly the seasons are changing, the snow is finally melting and the heavy layers and crampons have been replaced by a need for wide-brimmed hats and copious amounts of sun cream and water.</p>

<p>A sleepy bunch of Stockets emerged off the coach, bleary eyed, blinking in the March sunshine at the car park in Glen Esk. Eventually two groups formed, one heading for Loch Lee and an exploration of the hills south of the glen, whilst the larger group took the path north and west into Glen Mark. The good track means this approach to Mount Keen is easier and shorter than the approach from the north and though I had heard some complaints about the scenery, the dark crags of Gilfumman and the snow-capped hills at the head of the Glen drew the eyes onwards.</p>

<p>Another early start from Aberdeen this morning, but for a change the thermometer wasnâ€™t in the red, but instead, at 5:30am with light cloud cover, showed +5! Spring is truly on its way and it was a much more straightforward drive without the worry of ice and snow. After a quick run up the A9 I turned off, passed through a sleeping Blair Atholl and gently climbed up on the single track road, past the old Bridge of Tilt and out across open farm land to the parking point at the junction up to Monzie farm.</p>
