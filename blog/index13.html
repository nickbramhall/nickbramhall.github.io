<p>Saturday evening. The sun has slunk below the horizon, ashamed of its lack of show. Clouds drift lazily through a dark sky. Somewhere near the tent a snuffling is heard, a deer or sheep tugging gently at the tussocky grass I'm camped on. By the time I look out it has gone. Back inside, I draw the sleeping bag tight around my face and lay back, listening to the burn murmuring gently to my right. Life is good.</p>

<p>Glen Clova seems to be the perfect destination for an afternoon walk. I climbed Mayar and Dreish late one May evening and on Sunday chose to use a free and unexpectedly sunny afternoon to visit the summit of The Goet/Ben Tirran, a 798m high Corbett on the north side of the glen.</p>

<p>My approaching footsteps sent the sheep skittering away across the tussocky flats next to the river. They stopped some distance away bleating balefully and watching me pass by. Their flight had taken them in amongst the scattered stones of a long abandoned shieling, one of many that can be seen along the length of this overlooked glen. I was deep in the heart of Glen Dye, away from the people puffing and panting their way up Clachnaben, and enjoying the solitude and scenery in this pleasant little corner of the world.</p>

<p>It's a long drive to Tillicoultry from Aberdeen. This fact prompted the first 7am start of the 2011 calendar for the Stocket Hillwalking Club, but luckily it didn't seem to dissuade members or guests from turning out in healthy numbers. The long day would be rewarded with sunshine, piercingly cold winds, and snow, lots of snow.</p>

<p>I think it's fair to say that reliance on MWIS is both character building and somewhat exasperating. Saturday had been a splendid day in Aberdeen and I had enjoyed it with a wander around the town, a look round the brilliant <a href="http://www.aagm.co.uk/Exhibitions/Current/Diane-Arbus-ARTIST-ROOMS.aspx">Diane Arbus portrait photography exhibition</a> currently on at Aberdeen City Art Gallery, and coffee and carrot cake. The weather had been great; warm sunshine and hardly a breath of wind. For Sunday MWIS was confidently predicting 90% chance of cloud free Munros, only a little wind and reasonably mild temperatures. After initially thinking of heading to the Monadhliath, then the Laggan Hills, I finally decided to head south-west and make my first foray into the Lawers Range. I figured that the good forecast and a nice ridge walk would make an excellent combination.</p>

<p>I'm fairly sure that I am now a member of an elite and rather exclusive club: a club for those who count <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/munros/tolmount">Tolmount</a> as their most climbed Munro. Although I have almost been up Lochnagar three times, I aborted the last time in the face of incredibly strong winds, so now, having climbed Tolmount in <a href="/blog/2008/06/east-glenshee-6/">May 2008</a> and again in <a href="/blog/2010/08/jocks-road/">August 2010</a>, today was my third time on top of this mountain.</p>

<p>There's probably a little piece of Eastern mysticism relating to the fact that a little wind never hurt anyone. I was repeating this mantra to myself every step of the way along the broad and exposed ridge that curves around to the summit of Creagan a' Chaise, a Graham perched high above Speyside and close to the infamous Haughs of Cromdale. It marked the high point of Sunday's walk along the spine of the Hills of Cromdale which divide Glen Livet and the River Avon from the green fields of Strath Spey.</p>

It weaves together an exploration of wild places in Britain and Ireland with the stories of those characters, past and present, that have helped shape and define <em>wildness</em>.</p>

<p>Before the sun had risen I was driving down the South Deeside Road under less than promising skies. Refueling in Banchory I was intially confused by the football supporters loading up on energy drinks and junk food until I remembered that Aberdeen were playing Celtic in the Cup. I was pleased to be heading away from all this, gradually encountering quieter roads and a temperature that dropped down to 0C as I passed Mar Lodge on the Linn of Dee road.</p>
