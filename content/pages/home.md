<p>I'm Nick Bramhall, a backpacker and hillwalker living in Tillicoultry, Scotland. As well as being a <em>bagger</em> of the Munros (that delightfully quirky list of the two hundred and eighty-something Scottish hills over 3,000 feet), I also enjoy exploring the wilder, less visited corners of this beautiful country. The Mountain's Silhouette is a place for me to share my trips to the Scottish hills through words, photos and the occassional video.</p>

<p>This site features a collection of <a href="/blog">illustrated trip reports</a> covering day hikes and wild camping trips in the mountains; my own lightweight <a href="/gear">gear lists</a> for different seasons; and a number of <a href="/category/articles">articles on books, gear and technology</a> related to the outdoors.</p>

<p>My <a href="/photos">landscape photographs</a> have featured in <a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/">TGO Magazine</a>, on the <a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk">Walk Highlands</a> website and have been used in desktop calendars and for book and album covers.</p>
