I’m not sure whether the driver was slightly masochistic or just trying
to acclimatise us to the cold we would face once we jumped off at
Tarfside in Glen Esk, but it was absolutely freezing on the coach that
took the Stocket Hillwalking Club away from Aberdeen for a day out.
Actually, looking back, “jumped off” sounds a bit too active…. I’d met
up with some work-related friends at eight on Saturday evening and
finally got to bed at four the next morning. I was feeling particularly
bleary eyed as I stumbled off the coach into the bright winter sunshine
just a few short hours later. Water would have been good at this stage
but already my hydration pipe had frozen solid so it was a cup of sweet
black tea that did the job of slightly reviving me.

The rickety bridge across the North Esk (complete with liability defying
warning signs) further helped the sobering up process and then there was
a little bit of navigation fun to find the right vehicle track heading
up the open hillside to the bealach below Garlett and Cowie Hill. We had
climbed the hillside in the shade, enjoying the views over to sunnier
slopes on the south side of Glen Esk so it was a great feeling to top
out into the bright winter sunshine.

Here we took a brief break to take in some warmth and admire the views.
Through a gap in the hills to the west we had an interesting view of
Lochnagar, looking along the rim of its cliffs to the summit of Cac Carn
Beag. Northwest of us Mount Keen had streaky snow on its summit flanks.
All the hills shone below perfect blue skies.

From the bealach we continued roughly south following a good, wide stony
vehicle track that dropped down into the Burn of Berryhill where once
again we were in the cold shadow of the hills. As we climbed up over the
eastern shoulder of Knock Hill we came back out into the sun and with
hazy views ahead to West Wirren we stopped in a sheltered dry stream bed
to enjoy elevenses.

Feeling refreshed we marched on. Our intended route took us close to the
top of the Clash of Wirren, a dry cleft leading down towards Glen
Lethnot. Though we had debated about the best way to climb up to West
Wirren, on arrival the decision was made for us by yet another new
looking vehicle track that wound its way up the north side of the hill.
These tracks are far from pretty but they certainly made for good
progress and we were soon heading along the plateau. Here there was more
evidence of investment by the estate with newly constructed grouse butts
and strange markers, presumably to aid navigation around the network of
new roads.

The track took us up to the summit of West Wirren where the small cairn
was briefly visited. The views had now opened up to include a hazy Glen
Lethnot to the south as well as the tips of the snow-plastered
Cairngorms peeking over the lower hills to the west.

The track continued, circling around the rim of the large, cold corrie
separating West Wirren from the Hill of Wirren before finally climbing
up onto the wide plateau of this 639m high Graham.

The trig point is reached by leaving the track and crossing what were
thankfully frozen peat hags and bog. The trig stood in a puddle of
water, frozen solid, commanding views across the featureless plateau and
out to the neighbouring hills.

It was about lunchtime now and we could see our next target, East
Wirren. We decided however to return to the track, thinking that it
might well turn around the hill to eventually link up to a track we
could see climbing up to East Wirren. It didn’t. We ended up circling
back, almost returning to the trig point, where we found another
sheltered stream bed to enjoy a break for lunch. Though the ground was
still hard frozen the sunlight was warming and sandwiches were consumed
enjoying the views out towards the hazy fields and rolling flatland of
the Howe of the Mearns.

After lunch our way took us through a maze of peat hags until we
eventually linked up with a track climbing up from Glen Lethnot and
heading up to the summit of East Wirren. Another cairn commanded views
that were getting increasingly hazy with mist creeping across the flat
lands.

To the south the march of foothills towards Dundee stood out only as
faint pencil lines against the grey-white fog. It was a strange and
transfixing sight to see, though difficult to capture on camera.

From East Wirren we dropped off, initially south but then east once more
to reach the Hill of Corathro where we enjoyed the last of the expansive
views before dropping off to reach the first of the farms at Little
Tullos.

The track led us slightly off course so we cut across via the bottom end
of a small reservoir to reach it again. The farmyard was a little
intimidating but largely deserted so we crept past the cows in the barn
and finally found the right exit onto yet another track.

This we followed for some distance until we turned off onto a footpath
that eventually brought us to a proper tarmac road. This was followed a
short way before we took to the fields and hills again, climbing up over
a small brow beside a cold looking coppice to join a good straight track
heading for Edzell.

As the light faded we hit the main street of Edzell where the coach was
waiting for us outside the hotel. There was a warm and convivial
atmosphere as we enjoyed a pint or two and chatted about the excellent
day out we had enjoyed. By the time we stepped outside again it was dark
which only left the swift journey back up the A90 to Aberdeen, a fish
supper, and bed.
