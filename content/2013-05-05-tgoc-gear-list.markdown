_A look at the kit I’ll be taking with me on my coast-to-coast route across Scotland planned for May 2013_

In less than a week I’ll be setting off from Plockton on [my TGO Challenge](http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/04/tgoc-route/). Gear is of course a very personal thing and what I’ll be taking with me has, in most cases, proved itself over several trips over the last couple of years. There are a couple of new items but these got a reasonable [outing in Ardgour last weekend](http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/) and I’m confident that they’ll suit my needs. I was aiming for a baseweight of 8kg but have slightly overshot, mainly because of the addition of a pair of microspikes to deal with whatever remains of winter in the high mountains. This also details food required for the first stretch which is 4.5 days of walking to get me to Fort Augustus. Subsequent sections are shorter but I’ll be carrying store bought foods.

Base Weight is the weight of everything carried (in a pack or about your person such as in a camera bag). It excludes consumables (see below) and clothing worn (see the first category above). I also exclude walking poles since these are in my hands 95% of the time when walking.

###Consumables

- Gas: 0.23kg  
- Water: 0.5kg  
- Food (5 days to Fort Augustus): 2.93kg  

**Total Pack Weight: 12.33kg**

**Skin-Out Weight: 14.85kg**
