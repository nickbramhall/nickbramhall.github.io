##Day 1

The café in Achnasheen at lunchtime on Friday. Piping hot lentil and
vegetable soup followed by coffee and homemade cake. Outside sleet falls
from great grey clouds drifting over Strath Bran. I’m excited to be back
in the North West Highlands but a little nervous about the weather
forecast and how far my three season gear will be tested over the coming
couple of days. I’m also a little concerned about how much of a problem
the cold and flu I’m still suffering from will play a part in
proceedings.

At 2pm the car park at Craig was already almost full. I squeezed my car
into the one remaining viable space and got my kit sorted. I was still
pondering kit choices but finally settled on my Montane Extreme winter
jacket (leaving behind my Vapour Rise and shell jacket) and put my
microspikes into the top of the pack. It’s a cool 7 degrees as I set
off, crossing the road and the railway line and then following the easy
vehicle track along to the crossing over the river Carron. The sleety
rain had cleared and the sun was out. In the sheltered glen amongst tall
pines it was almost pleasant though the jacket remained firmly zipped
up. I came across a family having a late lunch by the track which is
flanked by bright yellow gorse and the occasional blossoming pink
flower.

Ahead of me the buttressed west wall of Sgurr nan Ceannaichean blocks
the glen, sending the track around its lower flanks until the view is
dominated by the twin summits of Sgurr Choinnich and Sgurr a’
Chaorachain linked by a perfect catenary ridge, dusted with snow. I left
the track and dropped down to the dubious bridge across the Allt a’
Chonais. A slow, steady few steps got me safely across and then I was
heading up on the excellent stalkers path which climbs a long ridge of
Sgurr na Feartaig, the Corbett which sits above Craig and the river
Carron.

This path is a delight, steadily gaining height whilst winding around
outcrops and lumps in the ridge. The views opened out with the
spectacular panorama of the Torridon hills catching my eye. More showers
were sweeping in but they passed to the east across Strath Bran and the
Fannaichs, leaving me in bright sunshine. I climbed up onto the lower
plateau of Sgurr na Feartig where its two lochans lie in splendid
isolation. The views were astounding and sheltered from the wind I sat
and munched on a chocolate bar, listening to the wind and watching the
sunlight play on distant hillsides.

I wound my way between the lochans and then followed the faint track,
mostly obscured by wind-blown snow, up towards the summit. It is a lumpy
hill but eventually the large cairn marking the summit hoved into view.
The sun was hidden behind a cloud and the wind fiercely cold. On the lee
side of the cairn I found some shelter and enjoyed the views over Beinn
Tharsuinn and the other Monar hills.

With a spattering of rain and the views closing in I headed off the
summit. It is very steep sided and the south east ridge is not well
defined so I ended up slightly off to one side, picking my way down a
slippery slope towards the Bealach Bhearnais. It was a relief to reach
the flat ground of the bealach where I was finally sheltered from the
wind and soon the sun came again out to warm things up. I passed a Laser
Competition pitched in a scooped hollow near the summit of the col.

Following the path I headed up from the col to the eastern end of Beinn
Tharsuinn. This long, winding hill is a Corbett with the summit at the
diagonally opposite end from where I was standing. After climbing the
steep eastern end it is then an easy walk along multiple summits,
crossing clefts and gullies which were acting as perfect wind breaks.
Off to the west were views of the sea and of Skye and as the rain clouds
moved away the hills to the east came back into view.

Ahead of me as I approached the summit cairn of Beinn Tharsuinn the
views of the West Monar hills were stunning. The long ridge of Lurg Mhor
and the distinctive peak of Bidein a’ Choire Sheasgaich had their
features picked out in snow, the sunlight catching the dark rock. At the
top the wind was once again gusting strongly but I put my sack down and
hunkered down to admire the views. The sinuous s-curve of Loch Monar
stretches out to the east; to the north west is Torridon; Skye sparkles
across the water; and all around me were fantastic mountain ridges and
summits. I had the place completely to myself and it was a special,
wonderful moment.

Time had crept on as I sat enjoying the summit and the hills were bathed
in early evening light by the time I got moving again. I dropped down
the south slopes of Beinn Tharsuinn, heading for the nameless lochan
that sits in shallow scoop before the big drop off into the glen below
Sheasgaich.

My plan was to camp here but on arrival besides the water I could tell
the wind was going to be an issue. I dropped my sack and did a
perambulation around the lochan, investigating every possible hollow for
shelter but everything came up short. The only calm spot was immediately
below the shoulder of Beinn Tharsuinn’s summit cone but just here the
ground was extremely boggy. Instead I followed the outflow from the
lochan a short way downhill to where a convenient line of crags provided
shelter from the wind. A flat area of dry land was all I needed and I
found it in short order, soon getting the tent up as a brief flurry of
hail fell from the sky.

I spent the Friday evening exploring the hillside around the camp,
gathering water and then cooking up some dinner. More hail fell as I sat
enjoying a delicious steak and ale stew.

At around 9pm, and as the light started to dwindle, I grabbed my camera
and an extra insulation layer and climbed the short distance back up to
the summit of the Corbett. Already the flurries of snow and hail had
formed an icy, white layer and at the top it was bitterly cold. It
didn’t matter though as the beautiful sight of the sun dipping towards
the Torridon hills was sensational. Although there was some cloud around
it served only to emphasise the colours, bathing the hills in a fiery
orange that turned reddy purple as the solar disc descended. At last the
sun disappeared behind thicker clouds banked beyond the hills and I made
my way carefully back down to my tent. Ice was rapidly forming on the
path and I found a thin crust already on top of the water in my
Platypus.

Above Lurg Mhor the full moon (a supermoon no less) had risen and it was
this that I watched as I lay back in my tent listening to a couple of
podcasts. Much later on I got out to brush my teeth and noticed that a
lot of the cloud had cleared. Venus shone over the lochan in the west
and there was pinprickling of stars across the hard blue dome of the
sky. The moon bright and full bathed the scene in a glorious light.

##Day 2

The second day, Saturday morning, dawned rather less fantastically than
the previous day had ended. Waking up cosy and warm in my down sleeping
bag surrounded by a heap of clothes that had been taken off in stages
during the night I could hear the gentle rustle of snow sliding off
silnylon. I poked my head out of the tent to be greeted by a white
world, cloud swirling across the cols and snow falling from leaden
skies.

It was still early so I rolled over and dozed for another hour or so,
waking up in a surprisingly warm tent. Blinking into the bright sunshine
I once again looked outside to find a transformed world. The cloud had
been swept away to leave the most remarkable of vistas: bright, snowy
mountains under a clear blue sky. I think I may have whooped as I pulled
on my solidly frozen shoes, donned a couple of layers of insulation, and
stepped out into this magical kingdom.

Coffee was the first order of the day and luckily the outflow from the
lochan was still free moving so I didn’t have to melt my frozen
Platyplus for a morning brew. Coffee and a cereal bar were consumed as I
wandered around, gazing off at the magical mountain panorama I had
awoken in.

Over my shoulder was the imposing north face of Bidein a’ Choire
Sheasgaich, and my challenge for the day. I wanted to climb the mountain
by this classic scrambling route but was a little concerned about the
ice hidden amongst its shadowed crennalations. I had done plenty of
reading over the preceding week and knew there was a good route up it
with just a few sporting sections of rock action. However, now I saw it
in person it was an intimidating sight, presenting 250m of jumbled crags
riven by impossibly angled gullies and crowned by a mighty headwall. Was
it possible? I guess I would find out.

Climbing back up to the lochan I got awesome views of the reflected
summit of Beinn Tharsuinn and then headed west, dropping down a steep
little scramble through a rock terrace and then along to the bealach
below the western top. It was an easy drop down angled grassy slopes to
the bealach below Sheasgaich where I now paused in the sunshine to look
up at the massed defences.

Following intelligence gained by reading other trip reports I initially
followed the dry stone wall which angled up and away from the bealach.
The ground was a little boggy at first but as I got into the shade of
the face itself the cooler temperatures meant it was crisper and my
footing was surer. The face turned out to be a series of terraces
connected by steep but easily climbed ramps, sometimes of rock but
mostly grass. I was quickly a third of the way up and already the views
were opening out. I now came to what turned out to be the crux. The path
seemed to split, with the clearer branch heading right a short way up to
the base of an arête. The other branch was fainter, angling up towards a
grassy ramp, laced with frost, which I imagine is the technically less
challenging route. I took a moment below the arête to stow my poles and
cinch down my bag before tackling the rock.

There were a couple of tricky moves to start with though helpfully the
holds were positive and it was easy to gain height. Then I got to an
area where the turf had been welded to the rock, albeit badly. I tugged
at a couple of holds which came away in my hand. Luckily underneath the
brittle turf I found a good hold and with a secure stance made the final
few moves to top out on another grassy terrace. Although the way was now
steeply up a grassy gully there were adequate footmarks and steps in the
turf so I was soon up. Although the headwall had looked tricky from
below, the path I was following picked out an easy weakness and I was
soon punching the air as I topped out at the balcony at around 800m. It
was a great feeling to have conquered such a challenging ascent in
pretty sketchy conditions.

From the balcony I took in the brilliant views both east and west as
snow covered hills were revealed rising up from the frosty glens. I took
a few minutes and then carried on, now walking up a gentle slope to the
plateau which runs across to the main summit. The snow was crisp and I
soon wended my way through the outcrops to reach the serene lochan below
the dark rock of the Munro’s summit pyramid.

After the earlier work it all felt very easy and after getting
distracted by a couple of Ptarmigan I was soon walking along the summit
ridge to the airy cairn marking the top of Bidein a’ Choire Sheasgaich.

As with any remote Munro at 10:30am in the morning it was only right to
encounter someone else. Quite unbelievably they had walked through from
Craig that morning to reach the summit just before me. This made me feel
very lazy. They took a few snaps and then headed off to Lurg Mhor,
leaving me to enjoy the peace and splendid position of this prized
Munro. The views down Loch Monar towards the Strathfarrar Hills were
sublime and south were the Mullardoch and Affric Hills with Loch Calavie
just making an appearance. I stood on the summit, sending a few texts
and munching on some food before observing that I was being followed up
by a group of four walkers. The guy in front reached the summit just as
I was about to leave and so we had a brief chat about the great
conditions and views. They had already done a couple of Munros the
previous evening and had camped back at Pollan Buidhe.

After this encounter I descended the easy south-eastern slopes of
Sheasgaich to the col below Lurg Mhor. It is hard to believe that this
grassy hill is the same mountain as that seen from the north. The climb
up Lurg Mhor was a bit of a slog through snowy boulder fields and the
weather was by now closing in, the skies grey and banks of sleety rain
moving through the glen, obscuring the Monar Forest Hills beyond the
loch.

I had the summit to myself and clambered up the cairn to take in the
views before being joined by a couple from Fort William who had
approached from the east. They were bagging Munro tops and so I quizzed
them about the scramble across the ridge to the eastern top of Lurg Mhor
which has a bit of a reputation. They said that most of the tricky stuff
could be bypassed and so, although my plan had been to return to the
col, I decided to go over and have a look at the ridge.

They moved off to get back to their tent beside the loch and I stayed on
the summit a while, munching on oatcakes, salami and cheese, looking out
at the drifting clouds over the Affric and Shiel hills and away out to
Skye. It was magnificent, a wilderness view in every respect with
lochan-pocked glens separating high snow-capped peaks.

After lunch and just before the foursome caught up I headed over to the
ridge. It would have been easier to head back to the col but I was
feeling adventurous and without any particular rush to be anywhere. The
ridge turned out to be great, 96% fantastic knife-edged ridge walking,
3% hands on scrambling and 1% all out
where-the-heck-do-my-hands-and-feet-go terror. After dropping quickly
down to the low point using good hand and foot holds I reached the
pinnacles. Although it is only a very short stretch of rock there are
definitely a couple of tricky sections. I took most of the pinnacles
direct but there was one I knew was quite tricky so when a bypass path
appeared I took it, thinking I had now missed the worst bit. Of course,
a couple of seconds later I was halfway around a pinnacle when I ran out
of footholds, my arms wrapped around a bulging block that was throwing
me out over a rather nasty drop. This was not what I wanted. I love
scrambling, but prefer it with a light daypack. With my camping pack on
my centre of gravity was wrong for the move. I quickly got myself into a
safe stance and then peered around the overhang. There was a shelf which
soon became the recipient of my bag and camera. Freed from these
encumbrances (and with the incentive of having to cross the pinnacle to
recover them) I found it was then an easy reach around the bulge to a
sure hold and in no time I was over, breathing heavily, heart racing.

The next pinnacle was even more ridiculous looking, a steep climb with
very little in the way of handholds so here I took the sensible decision
to drop down a grassy gully, bypassing the rock and then climbing back
up to the ridge. From here it was an easy walk along the arête to
quickly reach the point where it widened out onto the summit of the
eastern top of Lurg Mhor.

Now I thought, my troubles were definitely over. Wrong! The cloud closed
in and I now had to identify the best way to drop down to Loch Monar.
Meal Mor turns into a long gently sloping ridge that eventually drops
down to Pait Lodge, a long way from anywhere. Ideally I wanted to get
off the hill before then and I knew that other people had done it,
finding steep but manageable slopes. Unfortunately the topography of the
ridge makes it difficult to identify a good spot to start and rather
than just continuing along I soon came to the head of a wide coire that
was snow filled at the top and craggy towards the bottom. Something of a
path could clearly be seen at the top but I wasn’t sure exactly what
happened to it. I decided to give it a go.

About an hour and a half later I reached the valley floor. The descent
had been pretty unpleasant. Very steep, slick grassy slopes that wound
between crags and gullies with one in particular filled with the remains
of a recent cornice collapse. I never felt unsafe at any point but it
did necessitate very slow and careful footwork. The angle didn’t ease
off until right near the very bottom and so I was very grateful when I
could finally stand up properly. I angled off towards the head of Loch
Monar, the third tricky stretch of the day done!

Loch Monar is a dammed loch and the water level is currently a lot lower
than its usual height (or however the OS determine the extent of these
things?) so it was a muddy wade out to actually reach the shore. After
gazing out over the still grey waters I returned to the path through the
glen and followed it along a short stretch. I wasn’t sure what to do
now. It was 3pm and it seemed like the sun was coming out. If I wanted
to stick to my original plan I would have to reascend the steep slopes
on this side of the glen and then make me way along three further Munros
before finding a place to camp. In hindsight I could have found a good
camping spot en route but by this point, and after all the unexpected
scrambling, I was feeling ready just to relax.

I plumped my pack down and put up my tent. This was a good decision as
no sooner was the last peg in but a heavy hailstorm started. I retreated
inside and pulled out my Kindle and some snacks. I wasn’t going
anywhere.

To have walked six miles in a relaxed and lazy six hours, ascended a few
thousand feet and ended up in such a wild, unpeopled place felt pretty
special. I alternated over the next few hours between reading (when it
was hailing) and wandering around (when it was sunny). As evening fell
it started to snow more determinedly and after one such spell I looked
out to find the mountains white again with the snow line just a hundred
metres or so above the floor of the glen.

I enjoyed dinner and then dozed off in my tent as more clouds swept in
from the northwest.

##Day 3

Sunday morning dawned as bright and crisp as Saturday though this time I
wasn’t surrounded by a snowy scene. Lazy clouds drifted through but the
weather seemed remarkably settled. As the sun rose over the shoulder of
the hills the tent warmed up nicely and I was soon ready to brew up some
coffee down on the beach and have a wander around to wake up my stiff
legs.

I knew that MWIS were forecasting stormy weather for the afternoon and
so I was keen to get moving. By 8am I was packed and on the move, still
to determine my final plan. I climbed steeply up the slopes immediately
above my campsite. Soon the glen opened out below me and Loch Monar, the
sky perfectly reflected in its calm surface, stretched out languidly
into the sunny east.

The going was unrelenting but I gained height quickly, moving across the
hillside as the terrain varied from rocky to grassy to icy. Eventually I
was in the final throat of the gully which led me up onto the
spectacular ridge line just beneath the summit of Sgurr Choinnich’s
southern top, Sgurr na Conbhaire. The mountains were still dusted with
snow and there was a delightful looking ridge winding its way north to
the summit of the Munro. I stopped here, breathing in the crisp cold
air, sending a few texts and generally enjoying this solitary
magnificence.

From here I followed the ridge which gave a delightful high level
traverse above the coires of the Bealach Crudhain and the Toll a’
Chaorachain with views along the line of hills heading to Maoile
Lunnaidh.

As I approached the point where the spur ridge I was on meets the main
spine of the hills, cloud was drifting in and the snow underfoot was
getting deeper. At the junction I could have turned right and traversed
the ridge across to Sgurr a’ Chaorachain but I decided that could wait
for another day. Instead I turned left and walked along the mountain to
the summit of Sgurr Choinnich, the third Munro of the trip as well as
the high point at 999m.

The views came and went with glimpses of the Torridon hills, coated in
white, seen between gaps in the swirling cloud. To the south it was a
bit clearer and I could see the complete ring of hills I had come around
over the past couple of days. After chatting to a couple who were
heading off to do the ridge I started my descent, following a clear
snowy path down off the western arm of the mountain.

The way down was largely straight forward with just a couple of short
scrambly sections to clamber down. The weather conditions improved and
by the time I reached the bealach the sun was again shining.

A well constructed path climbs up to Bhearnais from Pollan Buidhe and I
followed this down towards the glen where the trip had started almost
forty-eight hours previously. I stopped at one of the side streams to
refill my bottle and in the sheltered glen with the sun shining down I
felt warm again. The view down the long line of hills into Glenuaig was
spectacular and I chatted to a chap who had driven up from Bristol to
bag some Munros.

At Pollan Buidhe itself the water level was low so the lack of wire
bridge wasn’t a problem. Across the water I chatted to a trio of
Glasweigen Corbett baggers who were interested in my tent and questioned
whether my Nuun tablet infused water (which was a virulent shade of
purple) wasn’t meths!

With the sun shining it was quite beautiful although the chill wind and
snow on the tops still meant it didn’t feel like May. However I was able
to lose a few layers of clothing before commencing the march out down
the land rover track, meeting my outward route sometime later. I crested
the pass and then enjoyed the descent down to Craig, stopping off at a
spot which enjoyed magnicient views of the Coulin Hills for a last
lunch.

Then it was back to the car and off to find refreshments. In hindsight I
should have driven down to Lochcarron because everywhere until Contin
seemed to be closed. After a brief stop there I was on my way and in
fact traffic on the A96 proved to be less bothersome than usual such
that I was back in Aberdeen before five. A quite wonderful trip. It was
nice for things to not be about mileage and summits, but just absorbing
the views and lingering over these wonderful hills.
