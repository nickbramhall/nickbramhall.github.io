In Viewranger, if you don't make any changes then all summits, whether they are a 3,000 ft Munro or a lowly HuMP will show as a blue ball. It would be more useful to be able to identify different summit types by colour. There is a way to do this but unfortunately it requires a bit of effort with a text editor; as far as I can tell, it is not currently possible to make these changes via either Viewranger's web or app interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all download your POI file for the hill list in question (it's easier to do this on a list-by-list basis before combining into a single POI import once you have made the changes). For Viewranger this comes in the form of a .gpx file with each entry being an individual summit. If you open this file in a text editor you'll see a long list of entries, each one covering a different summit with all the details necassary to display it in Viewranger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;wpt lat="56.96563" lon="-6.314678"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ele&amp;gt;0781.0&amp;lt;/ele&amp;gt;&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[Ainshval]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cmt&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[Ainshval]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/cmt&amp;gt;&amp;lt;desc&amp;gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[Ainshval]]&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/desc&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sym&amp;gt;filled circle&amp;lt;/sym&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/wpt&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key bit of information for our purpose is the following snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sym&amp;gt;filled circle&amp;lt;/sym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This specifies the symbol used when displaying the POI. In this case, the generic filled circle has been chosen. We need to replace this with something different, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sym&amp;gt;Red ball&amp;lt;/sym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is quick to do if there is only one entry to change, however, hill lists typically contain a few hundred entries and modifying each by hand would be tedious. Instead, use your favourite text editor to do a &lt;strong&gt;find and replace all&lt;/strong&gt; operation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Find: &amp;lt;sym&amp;gt;filled circle&amp;lt;/sym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code&gt;Replace with: &amp;lt;sym&amp;gt;Red ball&amp;lt;/sym&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will change each entry to use the red circle symbol. You can now save the file and then import it into Viewranger (if doing more than one list, make the &lt;em&gt;sym&lt;/em&gt; changes and then copy and paste all the entries into a single master file for import). Trial and error may be required to get the symbols right, especially if you want to see more then two or three summit types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Viewranger I have the following set:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munros in Red - &lt;sym&gt;Red ball&lt;/sym&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munro Tops in Purple - &lt;sym&gt;Purple ball&lt;/sym&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corbetts in Green - &lt;sym&gt;Green ball&lt;/sym&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grahams in Blue - &lt;sym&gt;Blue ball&lt;/sym&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you to everyone who has visited my blog, read my reports or looked at my photos, and particularly to those who have shared on social media or left a comment during the course of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18091909752/in/album-72157653039300568/" title="Kayaking on Loch Tay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8851/18091909752_575b8fcd21_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Kayaking on Loch Tay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2015 was a very enjoyable year. Although I didn't do as much long-distance backpacking as I planned, I still got out with the tent on a few occasions and climbed a good handful of new hills. At the end of October I got to the top of my 200th Munro which felt like a significant milestone after almost 8 years of hillwalking in Scotland. I have lots of great memories from the year that not only included solo walks but also a few adventures with Leslie, both walking and kayaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hillbagging and Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 2015 I covered a little over 400km and bagged 18 new Munros (with 4 repeats) and 6 new Corbetts. The highlight of my Munro year was the summit camp on my 200th Munro, Sgurr nan Ceathreamhnan above Glen Affric. I only managed six wild camps during the course of the year but each of them was memorable and four of them were on the tops of hills making for some great views at sunset and sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trip Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Winter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland had another mild winter but there was still snow to be found on the high ground. Between January gales I got out on a couple of occasions with others, once immediately after the new year to the hills above Strathdon with Dave, and then later in the month to the &lt;a href="/blog/2015/01/pitfichie-forest/"&gt;heathery hills above the Pitfichie forest&lt;/a&gt; not far from Aberdeen with the Stocket hillwalking club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16000489387/in/album-72157650084730592/" title="Descending to Glen Ernan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7476/16000489387_dbbee01d92_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Descending to Glen Ernan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16148813790/in/album-72157650084730592/" title="In Glen Ernan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7545/16148813790_21278ca0e4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="In Glen Ernan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695701343/in/album-72157651390916262/" title="Blue skies appearing over Cairn William"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7535/15695701343_e820f9c74c_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Blue skies appearing over Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February I ventured higher, repeating a couple of Munros in the White Mounth. The winds on the high plateau were incredible and dark clouds chased me back down past the Dubh Loch to the sunshine by Loch Muick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/23851155616/in/album-72157660260617604/" title="Head of Loch Muick"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5776/23851155616_6f2a01ee81_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Head of Loch Muick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my first backpacking trip completed in March when I returned to a favourite area: the &lt;a href="/blog/2015/03/north-monar-hills/"&gt;hills north of Loch Monar&lt;/a&gt; in the North West Highlands. I traversed two shapely Munros before a descent to a high col for a cold, starry camp. The next morning I climbed onto the remote Munro of Maoile Lunnaidh under brilliant blue skies with not a soul to be seen in such a wild and remote place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16685382237" title="Summit ridge of Sgurr Choinnich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8732/16685382237_099f4853b4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit ridge of Sgurr Choinnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the daffodils now in bud we headed along to Ballater to complete the classic walk around the seven bridges. We were hit by a heavy snow shower near a ruined castle but coffee and cake soon warmed us up back in The Bothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17109463942/in/album-72157661031791670/" title="IMG_20150411_130655"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7627/17109463942_cd7866e588_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="IMG_20150411_130655"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last weekend of April brought glorious weather all across Scotland. My friends Matt and Jenny travelled up from the Wirral for a weekend in the Trossachs and I joined them for a very enjoyable day up the Munro of &lt;a href="/blog/2015/04/beinn-chabhair/"&gt;Beinn Chabhair&lt;/a&gt;. The views were excellent and the fearsome bog was reasonably well dried out thanks to the baking sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17212464186" title="Ben Vorloch and the Beinn Glas Burn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7693/17212464186_0792291dab_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorloch and the Beinn Glas Burn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rounded off the day with a drink in the beer garden outside at the Drover's Inn before parting ways. After saying goodbye I chose to drive around the coast to Loch Fyne where I grabbed my overnight stuff and half-ran up the nearest hill, getting my tent pitched on the summit of Beinn Chas in time to enjoy the most magnificent sunset. The next morning I climbed the Munro of &lt;a href="/blog/2015/04/beinn-bhuidhe/"&gt;Beinn Bhuidhe&lt;/a&gt; with stunning views across Argyl and some interesting underfoot conditions as the snow on the summit ridge rapidly melted. It was a long walk back down Glen Fyne to the car but the reward was picking up a box of beer from the Fyne Ales brewery shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May brought about more adventures with Leslie when we decided to explore a stretch of the Coastal Path to the north of Aberdeen. The cliffs and coves near Boddam proved spectacular and we spent a very enjoyable day winding our way down to Cruden Bay, passing sea stacks and wheeling gulls, the Bullers of Buchan and the ruins of Slains Castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was keen to add some more new Munros to my tally but the spring weather failed to co-operate. In the end I managed with a day trip to Glen Lochay where lingering snow made the &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2015/05/creag-mhor/"&gt;round of Creag Mhor and Beinn Heasgarnich&lt;/a&gt; quite spectacular under mostly sunny skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally in June I found a decent weather window and this time headed to the North West to bag some &lt;a href="/blog/2015/06/coulin-forest-hills/"&gt;new Munros and Corbetts in the Coulin forest&lt;/a&gt; south of Torridon. These hills are monolithic blocks and I was glad when the tenacious clag finally cleared to give me some views from their lofty summits. Heavy west coast rain caught me up on the descent to Loch an Eoin where I camped for the night. Happily the next morning dawned still and sunny and I spent a great day traversing the long spine of Sgurr Ruadh before finishing on the Corbett of Fuar Thol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent three weeks of the summer enjoying hot and humid conditions in Georgia and North Florida. Summer in Scotland wasn't the best and it wasn't until August that I got out into the hills again. I finally ventured into the Ladder Hills, enjoying a pleasant circuit from Glenlivet where the heather was in bloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/19800426214/in/album-72157656564119498/" title="Glenlivet Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/386/19800426214_a9f0e94fdc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glenlivet Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on in the month I got the tent out again, completing an enjoyable circuit of &lt;a href="/blog/2015/08/east-loch-treig/"&gt;the hills east of Loch Treig&lt;/a&gt;. This took me up the long northern ridge of Beinn na Lap, a Munro more often climbed from the station at Corrour, before camping high and then returning to Fersit via the two Munros above the fjord-like Loch Treig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Autumn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unsettled weather continued into September but I managed to get a good weekend in the North West picking up five new Munros strung out along a &lt;a href="/blog/2015/09/cluanie-horseshoe/"&gt;horseshoe of interconnecting ridges between Glens Cluanie and Affric&lt;/a&gt;. I had a high camp in the clag but Sunday steadily improved and I got views from the final two hills of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-October brought unseasonably warm weather and I took the opportunity to revisit &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2015/10/bynack-more/"&gt;Bynack More in the Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt; before following a new route down to the east end of Loch Avon which was as still as glass. I followed the Avon down to the refuge and then bagged a new Corbett, Creag Mhor, on my way back to the car beyond Ryvoan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22605331036/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5628/22605331036_b65b8b9d8d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final big trip of the year took me back to the northwest Highlands and the &lt;a href="/blog/2015/10/west-affric/"&gt;western end of Glen Affric&lt;/a&gt;. Here a long walk in through An Caorann Mor from Loch Cluanie brought me through to Affric. I headed up to An Socach and then followed the wonderfully rugged east ridge all the way to the summit of Sgùrr nan Ceathreamhnan, my 200th Munro. After following the scrambly ridge to the west top I found an idyllic camp with incredible sunset views across to Skye and Knoydart. The next day was cloudier but I enjoyed a final Corbett before dropping down for a long walk out to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22351391961/in/album-72157659635914468/" title="An Caorann Mor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5620/22351391961_365abddebf_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="An Caorann Mor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;November was a bit of a write-off and it wasn't until late in December that I managed to get out - heading to the North York Moors with my Mum for a wander along from Cringle Moor to the impressive Wain Stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/23438753583/in/album-72157662906443876/" title="Untitled"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5722/23438753583_aabae9c4e8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Untitled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Scotland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visited family in Georgia during June and July. Whilst there we managed to fit in a few small hikes. I was very excited to finally set foot on the Appalachian Trail when we walked up to Preacher's Rock in the North Georgia Mountains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/19299927723/in/album-72157656181667231/" title="The view from Big Cedar Mountain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/427/19299927723_3b730da1dc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The view from Big Cedar Mountain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the coast we took a walk on the idyllic Cumberland Island breathing in the sights and sounds of maritime forest and a glorious stretch of white beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20544247921/in/album-72157656181667231/" title="Maritime forest on Cumberland Island"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/662/20544247921_5125cfde1f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Maritime forest on Cumberland Island"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 30 day walks and camping trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;25 different trips including day walks, kayaks and camping trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild camp on an island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not achieved this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb 50 new Munros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not achieved this year - 18 new Munros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to Torridon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, although the weather put paid to any walking on a stormy weekend in October. The sun was shining as we drove home of course...&lt;/p&gt;

It's the last day of 2014 and a good time to review another excellent year of trips to the Scottish hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, thank you to everyone who has visited my blog, read my reports or looked at my photos, and particularly to those who have shared on social media or left a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14766587801" title="Glencoe and Glen Etive hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5564/14766587801_da8280228b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glencoe and Glen Etive hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the year came in September when I &lt;a href="http://www.melissakilnerblog.com/2014/11/20/leslie-nick-married-foyers-lodge-scotland/"&gt;married my wonderful wife Leslie&lt;/a&gt; with Loch Ness behind us. It was the most beautiful and perfect day and flicking through the photos now brings huge smiles to both our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation and execution of the wedding somewhat curtailed trips to the hills in 2014, but whilst I might not have had the usual quantity of trips, those trips I did do were certainly of the highest quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/12841663055" title="Aurora Borealis, 27th February 2014 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/12841663055_4173343bc8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Aurora Borealis, 27th February 2014"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several standout moments, particularly those times at the beginning or end of the day when you have the hills to yourself. And, after years of seeing photos of it I finally stood on that lofty perch looking out over Fionn Loch and out to sea. It was an hour of quiet awe as I gazed out over lochs and hills from the summit of A' Mhaighdean in Fisherfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14106763527" title="Lost in the landscape by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3776/14106763527_b90ed49da2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Lost in the landscape"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also gave my first ever presentation featuring images and stories from my trips to the hills of Scotland. For their Valentine's evening, the science centre in Aberdeen put on a night of love-themed events. I spoke about my passion for the Scottish hills and how seeing them through the seasons and at all times of the day and night can bring a new appreciation for their beauty. You can view all the photos I used in the talk in &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/sets/72157641056616163/"&gt;this set&lt;/a&gt; on Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another great moment was camping with Leslie amongst the bluebells in Cannich in late May. After running some wedding errands we had a great day out exploring some of the waterfalls in Glen Affric. We are already talking about getting out more with the tent in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14260502364" title="Woodland Camping at Cannich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/14260502364_8dc943a4c0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Woodland Camping at Cannich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hillbagging and Stats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year I managed to bag 24 new Munros and cover almost 500km (1/5th of which was on the trip through Fisherfield!). A highlight of course was the summit of A' Mhaighdean with stunning views. I had 8 wild camps and enjoyed every condition from torrential rain and thunder through to frost and starry skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14296546731" title="Slioch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3720/14296546731_2969c88fa4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Slioch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the distance and ascent stats for the year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trip Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Winter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winter of 2014 was &lt;a href="http://www.theweathernetwork.com/uk/news/articles/uk-had-wettest-january-in-250-years/20821/"&gt;famed&lt;/a&gt; for both its storminess and its relative mildness, both of which impacted on good winter walking. In fact this combination curtailed a lot of walking early in the year and prevented me getting out for a wild camp until March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between storms I did enjoy a splendid day doing a &lt;a href="/blog/2014/01/glen-callater/"&gt;circuit of the hills above Glen Callater&lt;/a&gt; in the Mounth hills near Braemar where the sun shone on sparkling snow and the day ended with the most beautiful golden light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/11911550846" title="Coire Loch Kander by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/11911550846_a55cee2a1b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Coire Loch Kander"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/11894718375" title="Descent to Callater Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3677/11894718375_a4da0c61af_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Descent to Callater Lodge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;February was a write off but in early March I managed to get out in another brief weather window, this time heading into the heart of the Cairngorms for a &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/glen-lui-dee/"&gt;circuit around Glen Lui and Glen Dee&lt;/a&gt;. The Munro of Carn a’ Mhaim lured me to its summit but I quickly retreated as another winter storm rushed in from the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011270723" title="Coire Sputan Dearg beyond the Luibeg by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/13011270723_9dee37641b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Coire Sputan Dearg beyond the Luibeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011941524" title="Cloud over the Cairn Toul massif by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/13011941524_51ff8ab133_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloud over the Cairn Toul massif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012367064" title="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3006/13012367064_ddcba2f77f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor weather continued through the month and I ended up abandoning two high backpacking trips midway through as treachorous conditions made me seek the safety and shelter of the glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of these was with &lt;a href="http://www.mountainmusings.co.uk"&gt;Rich&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="/blog/2014/03/glen-lochay/"&gt;hills around Glen Lochay&lt;/a&gt; in Highland Perthshire. After a wild night below Ben Challum we retreated for warmth and hot food at the Watermill in Aberfeldy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13200366075" title="Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/13200366075_a35c529079_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13200397064" title="Rainbow in Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/13200397064_8fef93556e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Rainbow in Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was an attempt to do a &lt;a href="/blog/2014/04/loch-mullardoch/"&gt;circuit of Loch Mullardoch&lt;/a&gt;. Zero visibility, late snow and lingering cornices all hampered  my efforts and I eventually dropped off the ridge and retreated down the north shore path after a thankfully pleasant and sheltered night out in the wilds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13647283024" title="Erratic by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/13647283024_38fcae5fcc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Erratic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13544738603" title="Creagan Toll an Lochan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2929/13544738603_7eeb895b22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Creagan Toll an Lochan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13648151795" title="Allt Taige falls by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3674/13648151795_b12f196948_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Allt Taige falls"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early days of April were still windy but at least we were starting to see sunshine and a hint of warmth returning to the hills. I found a &lt;a href="/blog/2014/04/morven-mona-gowan/"&gt;new route to Morvern&lt;/a&gt;, an oft-climbed Aberdeenshire Corbett which offered good walking and fine views from its isolated summit. I had a go at putting together a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AC2auSBj4S4&amp;amp;list=UURws0Pr3uL9jUD9FbuBdO9g"&gt;short video&lt;/a&gt; of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885249587" title="Morven from Mona Gowan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/13885249587_4372fa097c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Morven from Mona Gowan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By early May it felt like Spring had truly arrived and I headed across to Loch Laggan to do a round of the three Munros which occupy the land north of the remote Ben Alder group. It was a spectacular day with early cloud breaking to reveal blue skies and sunshine catching snow-lined hills. The trio offered an easy but very pleasurable round and it was good to be back with views from the highest hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14099151684" title="Laggan and distant Speyside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7356/14099151684_b0d587546d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Laggan and distant Speyside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the weather much improved in May I was keen to get out for a good long backpacking trip. Whilst I wasn’t repeating my coast-to-coast of the previous May I did enjoy &lt;a href="/blog/2014/06/fisherfield-part-two/"&gt;five days backpacking into and through the famed Fisherfield wilderness&lt;/a&gt;, climbing some of the most remote Munros in the country and having a wonderful time. I spent five nights out in total and although conditions were dreadful on the first and last days, the intervening period was amazing with perfect sunsets and sunrises and the most amazing hills all to myself. The weather finally broke as I descended to Loch an Nid and I had my first experience of thunder in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14078608298" title="Fisherfield Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/14078608298_bcf2b511a5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Fisherfield Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week after a rather gloomy midsummer’s walk through Torridon and Flowerdale I found myself &lt;a href="/blog/2014/08/ben-starav/"&gt;summit camping high above Loch Etive on the Munro Ben Starav&lt;/a&gt;. I had chased rainbows past Loch Dochard and walked down Glen Kinglass before finally climbing up towards Starav. After some showers during the day the late afternoon was glorious and I decided to camp close by the summit rather than continue any further. I enjoyed the sunset with a couple of fellow campers and the next day returned along the length of the Black Mount ridge enjoying great conditions and splendid views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer was dedicated to wedding projects and so there were very few trips to the hills. We did enjoy a meander around Scolty Hill and scoped out photo opportunities in the beautiful surroundings of Foyers by Loch Ness. A wandering drive home after one of these trips took us for the first time to the Appin peninsula and the beautiful Castle Stalker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15590567242" title="Castle Stalker by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3956/15590567242_aa6778586b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Castle Stalker"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the wedding week we did manage an escape to the hills and I took the opportunity to introduce a few friends to the joys of the Munros. On a perfect September day with clearing mists and roaring stags we headed up from Kilfinnan farm in the Great Glen to visit both of the &lt;a href="/blog/2014/10/loch-lochy-munros/"&gt;Lochy Lochy Munros&lt;/a&gt;. There was sunshine and extensive views and everybody really enjoyed the experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the wedding there were more opportunities to enjoy being on this quieter side of Loch Ness with great paths and trails to explore straight out of the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15845365266" title="Loch Ness by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7477/15845365266_549cf5e818_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Ness"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Autumn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into October and the autumn colours started to come through strongly with the first hints of more unsettled conditions. We took my new father-in-law out on a few occassions to Deeside, particularly enjoying a stroll along the shore of Loch Kinord in magical late afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15577471012" title="Loch Kinord by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3937/15577471012_b4d6a8ff4f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Kinord"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a blustery day I finally climbed one of the nearest Grahams to Aberdeen - Pressendye - a long ridge of a hill that rises above Tarland in Aberdeenshire. After an initial protracted road walk, it offered a splendid round with fine views to the Mounth and Eastern Cairngorms. Morvern, climbed in the spring, was ever present just to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15512693499" title="Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7578/15512693499_14739a238d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Morven"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My final backpacking trip of the year came in mid-November when a promising weekend forecast beckoned me across to the North West Highlands. In fantastic conditions I &lt;a href="/blog/2014/11/inverlael-overnighter/"&gt;hurried around the four Munros of the Beinn Dearg group&lt;/a&gt; near Ullapool, finishing them just in time to pitch my tent and watch the sun disappear somewhere beyond Fisherfield. After a cold, frosty and starlit night there was a magical dawn as light crept over a scintillating world, slowly illuminating the hills of Coigach and Assynt, a bright moon hanging over the ramparts of An Teallach. I reached the lonely summit of Seana Braigh, my 182nd Munro, in time for lunch in the sunshine. A most peaceful and splendid place to end the year's big trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Snow arrived relatively late in the year, and with it the usual storminess. It wasn't until just after Christmas that calm settled and the mountains became a winter playground. I was down in Yorkshire spending the festive period with family but was still lucky to get out and enjoy a circuit around the hills near Kildale in the North York Moors National Park. The recent snow lent every vista a Christmas card quality and it was a pleasure to return along the Cleveland Way as the winter sun sank towards the misty Vale of Mowbray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15970250067" title="Baysdale by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8584/15970250067_cf991c65d7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Baysdale"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the targets I set myself this time last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach 200 Munros (i.e. 82 to go!) Mountains (still!) on my radar are the Far North Munros, the Fisherfield Munros, the rest of Knoydart and another big traverse in the south-west.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn't quite reach 200, I did get to 100 to go and had trips both to Fisherfield and to Ben Starav in the south-west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14776521191" title="Glencoe and Etive Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5554/14776521191_3a92452e8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glencoe and Etive Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild camp on an island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not achieved this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hillwalk in December&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, after many years with good intentions I finally got into the North York Moors over the Christmas period and had a wonderful day on moors around Kildale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16140675622" title="On the Cleveland Way by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7547/16140675622_966e950f59_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the Cleveland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targets for 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A total of 30 day walks and camping trips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild camp on an island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb 50 new Munros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to Torridon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp on Ben Hope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other People's Trips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another excellent year for outdoor blogging with people sharing trips and adventures and new people starting their own blogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed &lt;a href="http://runrideandsleepoutside.wordpress.com/2014/04/30/why-rush-a-backpack-around-fisherfield/"&gt;Rich's Fisherfield adventure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ness64.wordpress.com/2014/11/24/creag-meagaidh-circuit-tops/"&gt;Nicole's overnighter on Creag Meagaidh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.tramplite.com/2014/04/back-from-new-zealand.html"&gt;Colin's account of the New Zealand Te Araroa Trail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2014/09/13/into-the-wild-alone-in-sarek-and-padjelanta-part-one/"&gt;James' backpack through Sarek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ukbackpacker.wordpress.com/2014/10/21/solo-41-cairngorms-walk-from-blair-atholl-to-aviemore-day-3/"&gt;Rob's first backpacking trip to the Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ansgarsoch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/stage-2-cairnwell-to-dalwhinnie.html"&gt;Stefan's epic backpack of the Tay watershed&lt;/a&gt;. It was also great to see &lt;a href="http://paulbsramblings.wordpress.com"&gt;Paul Byrne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://wanderingsupnorth.wordpress.com"&gt;Peter Dixon&lt;/a&gt; start blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

And whilst a railway runs across it, and an A road skirts its edges, it is largely unaffected by intrusive man-made structures. The majority of Rannoch Moor is recognised as a core area of wild land in Scottish Natural Heritage's &lt;a href="http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/looking-after-landscapes/landscape-policy-and-guidance/wild-land/mapping/"&gt;Wild Land Areas Map&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent revision of which was published in June of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These areas of wild land are considered amongst the finest in the country and have been found to be highly sensitive to anything in the way of development. Now a Dutch company are proposing to site a new 24-turbine wind farm in this area, in a corner of wild land bordering Loch Ericht and Loch Rannoch at the eastern side of the moor. This is an area that I am very familiar with, having backpacked near it on several occasions. Though the site does not encompass any Munros or Corbetts, it would be highly visible from a large number of hills in the central Highlands, a visual intrusion completely unprecedented and unsuited to this beautiful, wild landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/7373656076" title="The end of Loch Ericht by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7244/7373656076_1b900ac9b9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The end of Loch Ericht"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Above) Seen from the slopes of the remote Munro Ben Alder the wind farm would cover the hills to the left of Loch Ericht stretching away towards Loch Rannoch just visible in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3563756934" title="Loch Rannoch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2441/3563756934_5ce745d672_b.jpg" width="1024" height="681" alt="Loch Rannoch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Above) Seen from the Invervar Munros of Glen Lyon the wind farm would stretch away from the end of Loch Rannoch towards the snow-streaked hills of the Ben Alder massif&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Above) Seen from the Munros above Loch Ossian the wind farm would cover the hillside beyond Loch Ericht to the right of centre of the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/9971555044" title="Loch Ericht by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/9971555044_f2f146bb86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Ericht"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Above) Seen from the pass above Kinlochrannoch the wind farm would dominate this view of hills to the east of the southern stretch of Loch Ericht&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal is seen as a test case through which, it is hoped, the strength and conviction of the revised Scottish Planning Policy will be demonstrated. It is vitally important for all other core areas of wild land that this development be rejected. Campaign groups, including local residents, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland and the John Muir Trust are calling on people to lodge an objection to this development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of how you can object are on the &lt;a href="http://www.mcofs.org.uk/talladh-a-bheithe-wind-farm-campaign.asp"&gt;MCofS campaign page&lt;/a&gt; and you'll have to hurry as these must be received by the 5th August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My objection letter is reproduced below and draws upon the eloquent letters already posted online by &lt;a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2014/07/08/keep-rannoch-wild-my-personal-objection/"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://iansommerville.com/blog/talladh-a-bheithe-wind-farm-objection/"&gt;Ian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Ms Gallacher,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am writing to you to object to the proposal from Talladh a Bheithe Wind Farm Ltd to erect 24 wind turbines on moorland between Loch Rannoch and Loch Ericht in Highland Perthshire. The basis of my objection is a) the potential for irrevocable damage to a key area of wild land and b) the impact this development would have on local businesses, residents and tourism in the area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scotland’s wild land is a unique asset, one recognised by the most recent update to Scottish Planning Policy (June 2014) which states:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Wild land character is displayed in some of Scotland's remoter upland, mountain and coastal areas, which are very sensitive to any form of intrusive human activity and have little or no capacity to accept new development. Plans should identify and safeguard the character of areas of wild land as identified on the 2014 SNH map of wild land areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The proposed development is within Wild Land Area 14 of the 2014 SNH map and only 2km north of the Rannoch and Glen Lyon National Scenic Area. This is an area of wild land at the very heart of Scotland, surrounded by iconic mountain landscapes, from Glencoe and Lochaber in the west to Ben Lawers and Schiehallion in the east, with Ben Alder and the southern hills of the Cairngorm National Park only a little way to the north. The visual impact of a major industrial site seen from these hills will irrevocably ruin the landscape for generations to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whilst I recognise the need to transfer to low carbon energy and increase our energy security I cannot help but think that siting wind developments in core areas of wild land is misguided and the result of short term target driven policy. Onshore wind power will be superseded by better technologies in wave and tidal generation within the next decade or two. At that point we will be left with aging onshore wind farms sited in areas that make it expensive and difficult to maintain and eventually decommission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We would be far better off not creating this problem in the first place and particularly not in areas of outstanding natural beauty which are enjoyed by native hillwalkers and visiting tourists alike. I note that there is considerable opposition to this development from local businesses who are far more effective than multinationals in creating local employment and, critically, retaining and using the profits of that employment in the local community. Residents too have expressed their concerns at the nature of the development. It appears to be the wrong proposal in the wrong place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I believe that planning policy should uphold the values of wild land and support local business and residents and urge you to reject this application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick Bramhall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please take a few minutes to put together your own words and send them through to the Planning Officer. Once a landscape like this is lost there is very little chance of restoring it and there is potential for this to open up the floodgates to other developments in the area with little or no consideration for their impact on wild land in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="snh"></category><category term="conservation"></category><category term="consultation"></category><category term="wild land"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review: The Atholl Expedition by Alex Roddie</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2014/02/atholl-expedition/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-20T09:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-02-20T09:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2014-02-20:/blog/2014/02/atholl-expedition/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A review of Alex Roddie’s historical fiction novel The Atholl Expedition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from his &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/11/the-only-genuine-jones/"&gt;debut novel&lt;/a&gt; Alex Roddie has once again produced an entertaining work of historical fiction. &lt;em&gt;The Atholl Expedition&lt;/em&gt;, his &lt;a href="http://www.alexroddie.com/p/forbes-challenge.html"&gt;new novel&lt;/a&gt;, is a short, pacy book centred around two contrasting ventures into the hills and glens of Atholl and Mar in the eastern Highlands of Scotland. Professor Forbes, an ailing glaciologist troubled by his professional past is seeking Scotland’s last glacier, rumoured to exist high in a Cairngorm coire, in the hope this discovery might rekindle his career. Meanwhile, on the same estate, Prince Albert, with the blessing of Queen Victoria, sets out with the Duke of Atholl to stalk a legendary deer which will likely lead him and his retainers into those same coires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novel, a fictional history featuring a mixed cast of real and imaginary people, weaves together these two stories as the heroes and villains clash over access rights and battle against the elements as a heavy storm sweeps over the hills forcing everyone to reassess their priorities and prejudices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Atholl Expedition&lt;/em&gt;, Alex brings the Victorian world of deer forests and vast sporting estates to life, and so constructs a fascinating context in which to tell his story. The book makes for an exhilarating read, pitting folktales and fairy stories against enlightenment science, whilst mixing in a bitter and emerging social conflict between the landowning elite, their loyal servants, and those wishing for freer access to the hills for both leisure and research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cast of characters is wonderful. Notable is the feisty portrayal of Queen Victoria, who weighs into matters both practical and personal, and the young apprentice forrester Duncan McAdie through whose eyes we see the first glimpses of a challenge to the entrenched social structure and attitude towards the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with his first book, Alex’s description of the place is masterful. The hills of the Mounth and the Cairngorms come alive as the characters make their way into the heart of the range. Geography and geology play an important role in the story but the descriptions are far from dry or utilitarian. Alex’s use of the wild places of Glen Tilt, the Tarf, Glen Dee and the coires of Braeriach will bring a smile to anyone familiar with these iconic areas. He has a great way with capturing the feel and atmosphere of a place with deft use of the language, rarely venturing into cliche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set pieces also work well, fast paced and full of drama they propel the story towards its conclusion. Unlike in &lt;em&gt;The Only Genuine Jones&lt;/em&gt;, I felt that the drama was more believable here, and the fantastical element came about organically through the fears of the characters themselves and the inter-mingling of folklore and superstitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the conflict that the young forrester Duncan McAdie felt between familial duty and the urge to seek an escape from the hard life of the glens. Forbes too is a brilliant character, motivated by personal feelings, he also starts to realise a different sort of affinity with the mountains. The realisation of his deeper purpose forms much of the more philosophical aspect of the book. I enjoyed the scientist responding to personal feelings engendered by wildness such as in this wonderful passage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although his scientific training demanded scepticism, Forbes wanted to believe in it. A more primitive part of him, his soul perhaps, felt the thrill of the wild deep in his bones, relished the cutting wind on the heights, responded in some primeval way to the roar of a stag. That part of his mind could be moved to tears by a sunset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the philosophy is strong I found the pivotal shift around which this new series shifts to be a little less dramatic than that which underpinned &lt;em&gt;The Only Genuine Jones&lt;/em&gt;. However I trust Alex to develop this world further. It should be noted that this is only the first book in a new series of novels Alex is writing, Alpine Dawn, which will explore the early years of Victorian mountaineering and the ongoing social upheavals as ancient ways of life begin to change. I look forward to seeing how the story develops and how the world is further fleshed out with more locations, characters and adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bGuahp" title="Glen Tilt by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Tilt" src="https://v4s.yimg.com/so/7184/7021721883_f276ab2d68_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can thoroughly recommend this to anyone with an interest in the Cairngorms or the Victorian world. It is a short book but serves as a bold introduction to this new world Alex is creating. At times the stuffiness of Victorian dialogue can make it feel a little forced but the action is pacy, the plot exciting and the range of characters - from the dastardly to the heroic - make for a gripping tale of adventure set in a familiar but refreshingly different world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like 2012, this year I've done plenty of backpacking and longer routes, with the clear highlight being the 200+ mile coast-to-coast I did across the country in May. I've also enjoyed some excellent day routes and finally reached the half-way point of my Munro round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hillbagging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 16th May I arrived on the summit of &lt;a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/cairngorms/geal-charn.shtml"&gt;Geal Charn&lt;/a&gt; at the southern end of the Monadhliath Mountains. This was my 141st Munro, marking the midway point of my Munro round! In 2013 I bagged a total of 20 new Munros, and revisited a further six 3,000 footers. I have now completed 56% of the Munro list having now visited 158 Munro summits. I also bagged 13 new Corbetts, my highest total for a single year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evWXzC" title="Summit of Gael Charn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Gael Charn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3708/8871539386_43d1c8b101_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Favourite new Munros included the Ben Cruachan massif with its stunning rocky summits connected by airy ridges, and the group of five Munros above the Bridge of Orchy which I traversed in a single long day which started with a beautiful inversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN6HiE" title="The dramatic west face of Ben Cruachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The dramatic west face of Ben Cruachan" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7351/9054311308_7a50040379_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst the new Corbetts, Beinn na h-Umha in Ardgour was a highlight on one of the very best days of the year, and in the same part of the world but half a year earlier, Sgurr Ghuibhsachain provided challenging scrambling and immense views as part of a wonderful round in the northern part of Ardgour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2013 I covered more than 1,000km and climbed over 36,000m. Below are my distance and ascent by month for 2013. Once again I entirely failed to do any sort of hillwalking in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Favourite Trips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winter&lt;/strong&gt; brought my first wild camp on snow in the Slugain glen near Braemar as part of a round of the &lt;a href="/blog/2013/02/glen-gairn/"&gt;glens in the eastern Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was followed by a nice &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/loch-an-daimh/"&gt;high-level circuit of Loch an Daimh&lt;/a&gt; in Perthshire taking in the two Munros which are more often than not done as two separate out-and-backs from the dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snowy weather late in March kept me low but I still enjoyed a brisk walk &lt;a href="/blog/2013/03/loch-kinord/"&gt;around Loch Kinord&lt;/a&gt; out beyond Aboyne on Royal Deeside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;spring&lt;/strong&gt; was dominated by the TGO Challenge. Grand plans for preparatory trips boiled down to &lt;a href="/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/"&gt;two nights in Ardgour&lt;/a&gt; to test out a new rucksack and this turned out to be one of the great trips of the year, bagging Corbetts in the wild land between Loch Linnhe and Loch Shiel with fabulous views and great wintry weather. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was off to Plockton to start &lt;a href="/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-1/"&gt;my coast-to-coast&lt;/a&gt;. Over 12 days I covered more than 200 miles before arriving amongst sunshine and showers on the east coast at St Cyrus. The journey was wonderful with a huge mix of weather, some great wild camps and lots of fabulous mountain scenery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rounded off the spring with another big trip, taking in the &lt;a href="/blog/2013/06/ben-cruachan/"&gt;four Munros around Glen Noe&lt;/a&gt; and diverting off to visit Glen Kinglass and Loch Etive, enjoying a superb high wild camp with sublime views out to Mull with a night sky lit by Noctilucent clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;summer&lt;/strong&gt; began with a misty crossing of the &lt;a href="/blog/2013/06/the-minigaig/"&gt;Minigaig pass&lt;/a&gt; between the A9 and Glen Feshie rounded off by a great barbecue in the sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed a fabulous &lt;a href="/blog/2013/07/lochnagar-stuic/"&gt;scramble up the Stuic buttress&lt;/a&gt; before visiting some less frequented parts of the Lochnagar massif. Down in the Lake District I climbed my first ever Wainwright, and then another 9 by completing &lt;a href="/blog/2013/07/coledale-round/"&gt;the Coledale Horseshoe&lt;/a&gt; near Keswick on a glorious July day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of the summer was camping on the beach at Sandwood Bay, the most perfect weekend of the year, with my girlfriend who climbed her first Munro the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eK2Y9z" title="IMG_2170 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_2170" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/9019631305_ff75e9b3d8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good weather deteriorated quickly and I had a &lt;a href="/blog/2013/08/glen-dee-overnighter/"&gt;stormy visit to Glen Dee&lt;/a&gt; with a wild camp on the summit of Sgur Mor followed by a retreat from a Munro the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;autumn&lt;/strong&gt; had yet more changeable weather but I managed a fine &lt;a href="/blog/2013/10/cairngorms-traverse-13/"&gt;traverse of the Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;, visiting the wild, remote waters of Loch Avon for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then started increasing my Munro tally, bagging &lt;a href="/blog/2013/10/achaladair-group/"&gt;5 near the Bridge of Orchy&lt;/a&gt; before completing a second &lt;a href="/blog/2013/09/so-central-backpack/"&gt;long backpacking trip&lt;/a&gt; heading north from Killin and finishing up four days later at Kingussie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two excellent club outings, one to the Corbett of &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/monemenach/"&gt;Monemenach&lt;/a&gt; and then with the first snows lying on the Cairngorms, a circuit taking in Brown Cow Hill with great views across Deeside and Ben Avon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rounded off the year with a wonderful week staying in a wee cottage in Ardgour  with my girlfriend. I used this as a base for two excellent Corbett outings: Beinn na h-Uamha, which I did straight from the cottage; and Ben Resipole which was climbed from Strontian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick review of the targets I set myself last year...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gWLRYQ" title="Mull by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mull" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/10465195364_a02816b75b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach 182 Munros - &lt;em&gt;No. I did reach my halfway Munro but didn't quite keep the momentum going and finished the year on 158&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit an Island - &lt;em&gt;Yes, visited Mull and Iona but didn't climb any hills on them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a continuous walk of more than 100 miles - &lt;em&gt;Yes, more than 200 miles on the coast-to-coast!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp every month of the year - &lt;em&gt;No! February through to September&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqCCpz" title="An Socach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Socach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7285/8811380391_ed907e190a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts on what I'd like to achieve next year...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eYgWc3" title="Summer in the Grampians by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summer in the Grampians" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/9169470736_1e909e8c67_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach 200 Munros (i.e. 82 to go!) Mountains (still!) on my radar are the Far North Munros, the Fisherfield Munros, the rest of Knoydart and another big traverse in the south-west.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wild camp on an island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hillwalk in December&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egdPtz" title="Clouds Racing by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds Racing" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8127/8704886475_fe9d847f73_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Land is one of this country’s most important natural resources and the importance of this landscape for biodiversity, for recreation and tourism, and for the rural economy cannot be underestimated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no doubt in my mind that Wild Land in Scotland is under threat now more than ever before. New developments, increasingly on an industrial scale, are moving away from well established infrastructure corridors and encroaching on land that has little in the way of existing development beyond perhaps a track or footpath, or a small estate building.  This is exemplified by the proposal at Allt Duine where a large wind farm will cause significant visual intrusion into the Cairngorms National Park, as well as scarring a large area of outstanding wild land for generations to come.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am concerned that every approved development diminishes the appeal of wild land both in the immediate area, and the wider vicinity and will ultimately have a strongly negative impact on the public’s enjoyment of the Scottish countryside and on nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am strongly supportive of the Wild Land 2013 Map and the methodology behind its creation. It takes into account the fact that no land in Scotland is true wilderness, but that there is still a tangible sense of wildness in many of our landscapes. I believe the map is a strong representation of the precious and diminishing amount of wild land that we have left and that it should be adopted and used by local authorities, the Scottish government and others to protect wild land and ensure that our children and grandchildren can enjoy the same beauty that we find out there today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The map lays down clearly defined boundaries within which wild land can be protected and will help focus new and existing conservation and stewardship programmes. Wild land should not be at the mercy of tens if not hundreds of development applications that must be individually challenged, but under an umbrella protection that prohibits any insensitive or unsustainable development that reduces wildness. This map provides a clear, visual way of facilitating that protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/arJ8nX" title="Foinaven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Foinaven" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6175/6198342837_bcba637372_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whilst I see this map as part of an ongoing discourse about Wild Land, I think the methodology used by SNH has resulted in a true and accurate portrayal of significant and important areas of wild land in Scotland. My eye is drawn to the North West Highlands and the fabulous Flow Country in the Far North which are both landscapes renowned for their scenery and habitat and are visited and enjoyed by countless people from home and abroad. I would urge agreement on this map as it stands today as soon as possible so that binding protection can be offered to our core areas of wild land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is important to recognise that the boundaries on the map represent a range of landscapes, each with their own particular importance. Whilst there are some existing protections offered, such as in those areas covered by our two National Parks, there should be immediate and binding resolution to protect, through appropriate means, ALL the areas covered by the SNH 2013 map to ensure that these areas of wild land do not shrink any further and that developments are not allowed to erode these boundaries. Existing protections are simply not sufficient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/9wxYLC" title="Towards Green Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Green Hill" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5109/5596588468_1dd2067cd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is apparent from the methodology used that some areas of existing wild land have been omitted because there are already proposed developments intended for that area. These developments are likely to be the subject of challenge as people increasingly respond to calls to protect our wild land. It may be that these developments are rejected and do not go ahead. In this case the area would not be under the umbrella protection offered to wild land despite remaining wild. Developments still in the planning process should not be used to determine the extent of wild land boundaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mapping focuses on upland and mountain areas. It may be that in a future review of wild land, lower-lying coastal and peat land areas can be brought into consideration. These areas may be smaller (i.e. narrow coastal fringes) but are nonetheless important for biodiversity and perceptions of wild land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would like to emphasise that the public perception of wild land is strongly in favour of safeguarding and protecting these unique landscapes, as found by a recent survey of the public carried out by the two National Parks in conjunction with SNH. We need to take strong, positive action now to safeguard wild land and leave a lasting legacy worthy of a progressive, intelligent and compassionate society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later and I now have an approved route for this year’s Challenge. My route has been checked over by a veteran of the Challenge and given the green light. Happily my vetter was very positive about my submission, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to say that, apart from a couple of minor queries, your route appears to be very well thought out, very well presented and with generally safe and practical FWAs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those minor queries have now been addressed and what follows is a brief overview of my route eastward through the Highlands of Scotland. You can view the route (and my proposed Foul Weather Alternative (FWA)) over on Social Hiking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1 - Plockton to Fort Augustus (5 days)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stage 1 Route" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/map-stage1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing Scotland from east to west on the train and fueling up with a pub lunch at the Plockton Hotel I’ll set off from the picturesque west coast village heading eastward. The first day is a lowish route along tracks and paths and over some open, boggy ground to reach the River Ling for my first wild camp of the trip. This leads on to what should be a glorious day crossing the two Corbetts that rise above Killilan before dropping down to the end of Loch Mullardoch for a second wild camp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/8c5eKg" title="Gleann a' Choinich and Sgurr nan Ceathreamhnan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gleann a' Choinich and Sgurr nan Ceathreamhnan" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4033/4719805521_774cc76ca4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day three should be another great day with the high hills of western Glen Affric on the agenda. After a trio of Munros, including Sgurr nan Ceathreamhnan, I’ll drop into Affric for a wild camp amongst stunning scenery. This then leads me to the Clunie Horseshoe on the fourth day with more Munro opportunities until I drop off the east end of the ridge and into Glen Doe. From a wild camp by the River Doe it should now be a fairly easy walk on the fifth day to take me east into Fort Augustus where I have a B&amp;amp;B booked for a night of R&amp;amp;R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/8bWY6P" title="The Head of Loch Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Head of Loch Affric" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4033/4718387105_83202506bf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 2 - Fort Augustus to Aviemore (3 days)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stage 2 Route" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/map-stage2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a comfortable night in Fort Augustus I’ll set off into the Monadhliath Mountains stocked up with whatever delicacies I can find in the local grocery store. Many people choose to post themselves food to collect at campsites or hostels but  I’m fairly sure I’ll survive well enough on store-bought couscous and pasta for a few days. Of course this food will be a bit bulkier and a bit heavier but the following stages are shorter so it shouldn’t be too much of a burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/aFdUzV" title="Sunlight on the Monadh Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight on the Monadh Liath" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6041/6351072495_8e9a24bf33_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Fort Augustus I now take a couple of nights to traverse the length of the high, rolling spine of the Monadhliath. Here there are a clutch of Munros and the odd Corbett to pick off but mainly it should be fabulous high level walking with very few paths going in my direction. My planned FWA takes me through the glens to the north and west that run through the heart of the range, but it is equally possible to drop down into Strathspey should conditions prove difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cPgYA1" title="Beyond Strathspey by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beyond Strathspey" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8444/7754916796_93db01bff7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day I have a short run down into Aviemore where I have booked into the Youth Hostel and can restock on food (and beer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 3 - Aviemore to Ballater (3 days)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stage 3 Route" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/map-stage3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNWQN3" title="Lurcher's Crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lurcher's Crag" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8440/7751183454_fb4fa522fd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now take a wandering route through the Cairngorms, first climbing up towards the Lairig Ghru before diverting off to climb Ben Macdui via Lurcher’s Crag. I then drop down to Glen Derry via Etchachan. On the second day I pass through Clas Fearnig, upper Glen Quoich and then head east along Glen Gairn to camp near Corndavon Lodge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/byY1n4" title="Looking west down Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking west down Glen Gairn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7036/6936623045_5423bfa6e3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day takes me further along the Gairn before leaving the glen to traverse Geallaig and then drop into Ballater. After suitable refreshments and a restock I intend to cross the hills via the Mounth track and camp in upper Glen Tanar near the Mount Keen footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 4 - Ballater to St Cyrus (3 days)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Stage 4 Route" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/map-stage4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/4yEn8j" title="The Road Goes Ever On by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Road Goes Ever On" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2068/2338683500_3c03482bd3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There now follows a couple of days of wandering the heathery hills of the Mounth, threading a path between bog and electric fence and crossing such iconic summits as the Hill of Cat, Tampie and Mount Battock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/9tMYGR" title="Mount Battock from Glen Dye by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Battock from Glen Dye" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5137/5565370329_e4030c8227_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final camp on the hills above Edzell sets me up for a final tramp along minor roads to the east coast at St Cyrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total is about 270 miles with plenty of height gain and some big days along the way. There are some familiar places and plenty of new mountains and glens to explore. Who knows what the weather will throw at the Challengers this year, but if it turns foul I have a lower route worked out that largely parallels the above. It will mean missing out on summits but hopefully (especially for the western hills) the sun will shine, winds will be light and I’ll spend many glorious up high. I’m really looking forward to setting off!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="tgoc"></category><category term="tgo challenge"></category><category term="2013"></category><category term="route"></category><category term="plan"></category></entry><entry><title>2012 in the Scottish Hills</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/12/2012-in-the-scottish-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-31T09:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-12-31T09:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-12-31:/blog/2012/12/2012-in-the-scottish-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A review of my year hiking and backpacking in the Scottish mountains&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another December has come around, bringing with it a series of Atlantic lows rather than a Mayan apocalypse.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had a fantastic year in the hills and mountains of Scotland. In 2012 I focused on extending my backpacks into multi-day routes completing a number of successful three-day trips and one longer four-day trip, all of which took me to interesting new parts of the country and saw me bagging a number of new Munros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hillbagging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim with increasing the amount of backpacking trips this year was to boost my Munro count and get me to the halfway point (282, now that &lt;a href="http://www.themunrosociety.com/fisherfieldpr.asp"&gt;Beinn a’Chlaidheimh has been confirmed as a Corbett&lt;/a&gt;). However, though I made a good start, as in past years the weather seemed to deteriorate after the early summer and trips later in the year failed to deliver the number of new summits I was hoping for. Nevertheless I bagged 39 Munros, 23 of which were new. This has increased my total to 138 Munros, just 4 short of the halfway point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bySpSo" title="Ben Challum from Cam Chreag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Challum from Cam Chreag" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/6935531446_a736de4502_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favourite new Munros included the remote Ben Alder, north of Rannoch Moor, visited as part of &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/06/travels-in-the-ben-alder-area-part-1/"&gt;three day backpack&lt;/a&gt; taking in a grand total of eight Munros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awesome Beinn a’ Choire Sheasgaich, with its fabulous scrambly northern slope, lived up to expectations as part of a &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/05/backpacking-the-attadale-hills-slowly/"&gt;three day trip in the Attadale Hills&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it was the worth all the repeat visits to finally get a view from Braeriach on a wonderful August day as part of a round of the &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/08/breaking-the-curse-of-braeriach/"&gt;western Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 2012 I covered almost 800km and climbed over 36,000m. Below are my distance and ascent by month for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wild Camping and Backpacking Trips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 was the year where I truly embraced backpacking and camping in the wild places. I spent thirteen nights in my tent, besides streams and lochs, camped on summits, in the snow and wind and rain, and in glorious sunshine. I awoke high above the clouds and surrounded by a world of snow and ice. I saw sunsets and sunrises and saw the planets align and the Milky Way arc overhead. I found my camp routine and only had one really bad midge experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ceEWGf" title="Wild camping above Loch Ossian by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camping above Loch Ossian" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5333/7374637142_237fdc49e8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few photos and thoughts from my favourite backpacking trips of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blair Atholl to Aviemore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bGvpQx" title="Carn a' Chlamain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn a' Chlamain" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6102/7021965955_63a66bc137_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took advantage of the unseasaonably warm late March weather to do my first two-night backpacking trip. I took the train from Aberdeen to Blair Atholl and then started heading north. From Glen Tilt I climbed my first Munro and then headed over to camp on a saddle below the summit of a neighbouring Corbett. After waking up to a hazy cloud inversion I made my way north through remote country, picking up another Corbett and three more Munros around the Tarf before dropping down to camp besides the upper River Feshie. It was an idyllic evening for star gazing. The final day took me north up the River Eidart and then across the western Cairngorm plateau to bag two more Munros with stunning views of Loch Einich. After a long ridgewalk there was a fun descent and then it was through the Rothiemurchas forest to reach the train station at Aviemore after a long day in unrelenting sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Attadale Hills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bTM2xF" title="Camp on the first night by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camp on the first night" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5199/7149494217_40491f4df9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip started with hot soup and a cake at Achnashellach, watching snow showers playing out over the mountains. Nevertheless I walked in under sunny skies and only a brief snow flurry on the first Corbett dampened the day. Walking along Beinn Tarsuinn’s summit plateau brought stunning views of the Attadale hills and then I found a stunning high camp near the unnamed lochan with views to Lurg Mhor and Bidein a’ Choire Sheasgaich. The next morning I scrambled up the stunning north wall of Cheesecake, gaining my first Munro summit, and then contoured around to Lurg Mhor. More scrambling got me to the eastern top and then it was an interesting descent to the shore of Loch Monar where I camped. The next morning good weather and further snow took me back high for another Munro before I decided to head back to the car with bad weather moving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stepping off the train at the remote Corrour station halt is a fantastic way to start a three day adventure. I climbed above Loch Ossian and bagged a couple of Munros before dropping down to camp besides the Uisige Labhair. The next day was fabulous and I covered 20km and 6 Munros, including the stunning Ben Alder. The end of the day saw me camp high on the shoulder of Beinn Eibhinn enjoing stunning views out across the Highlands. The sunset was magnificent and sunrise the next morning was just as good. I headed out to Fersit by way of the still waters of Ghuilbinn and it was only as I was reaching the car that the good weather truly broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A uni friend, Rich, came up for a spot of bagging in the Cairngorms. From Whitewell we wandered through the misty Rothiemurchas eventually climbing above the cloud as we came to the Lairig Ghru. Under stunning blue skies I finally (third time lucky) got the glorious views from the summit of Braeriach. We made our way along the high cliffs to eventually make camp below the Devil’s Point. Heavy rain showers drifted in and out through the afternoon. That evening as Team GB were winning multiple Olympic golds we stood on the summit of the Devil’s Point. The next day started cloudy but we headed around to the Moine Mor and then across to Sgor Gaoith as the sun reappeared. After walking along the ridge we were caught by the rain again which was torrential until long after we had made it to the pub in Aviemore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year’s big trip was cut short my a combination of weather and other committments but I still thoroughly enjoyed my four day backpack. From Glenfinnan station I completed the horseshoe of two Munros above the glen before dropping down to camp below Streap. Waking to wind and rain I took my foul weather route through Glen Dessary and then down to Sourlies and Loch Nevis. The weather brightened up and I headed up the River Carnach to eventually camp in the shadows of Knoydart. The third day saw me ascending Luinne Bheinn for the stunning views out over Knoydart and the west coast and then heading out via Barrisdale along Loch Hourn. A storm system came in overnight and I spent the last day fighting wind and rain below the South Shiel ridge to eventually reach my car at the Cluanie Inn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Targets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unofficially set myself some targets last year. Here is a review of how I did...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cjRvnd" title="Lochan Fada by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan Fada" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5312/7433280650_2f01cf5c53_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit Fisherfield - completed in June with a &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/06/through-the-great-wilderness/"&gt;through-walk from Corrie Hallie near Dundonnel to Kinlochewe&lt;/a&gt; via Sheneval, the Fionn Loch and Loch Maree. Next up will be a return to climb the Fisherfield Munros and Corbetts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit Knoydart - completed in August. I climbed Luinne Bheinn as part of my Glenfinnan to Glen Cluanie backpack. A glorious day in Knoydart but forecast bad weather meant I didn’t have time to linger and fully explore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit an Island (not Skye) - not completed this year. Jura is high on my list for next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a walk of 100 miles or 7 days - not completed. For various reasons I had to delay my planned long walk, originally intended for June, to August. Then I had to cut that down to 5 days to meet other obligations and finally bad weather caused me to finish the hike a day early...! I’m still pleased I did a 4 day/50 mile hike (whilst my longest backpack in 2012 was a 56 miler from Blair Atholl to Aviemore over two and a half days) and in general I pushed my trips further and longer this year, doing a few 2 night trips as well as a decent number of overnighters. Next year I have time booked off work to commit to a longer walk, up to 2 weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bexZPM" title="Climbing up the Hill of Wirren by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing up the Hill of Wirren" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6716925119_665988693c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other People’s Trips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some highlights for me from other people’s blogs of Scottish trips included Ness64’s &lt;a href="http://ness64.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/loch-affric-to-the-west-coast/"&gt;Affric to the West Coast&lt;/a&gt; , David Lintern’s visits to &lt;a href="http://www.selfpowered.net/2012/03/skye-high.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SelfPowered+%28self+powered%29"&gt;Skye&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="http://www.selfpowered.net/2012/09/knoydart.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SelfPowered+%28self+powered%29"&gt;Knoydart&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Salmond’s adventures above &lt;a href="http://paulsblog.sammonds.com/2012/03/30/sgurr-gaorsaic-sgurr-nan-ceathreamhnan-mullarch-na-dheiragain-glen-affric-kintail/"&gt;Affric&lt;/a&gt;, Geoff C’s &lt;a href="http://v-g.me.uk/blog/backpack-trip-reports/around-the-etive-mountains-5-day-backpack/"&gt;circuit of the Etive mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Fraser’s trip to &lt;a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/lochnagar/"&gt;Lochnagar&lt;/a&gt; and James’ &lt;a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/a-wander-on-the-wild-west-coast-of-jura-pt1/"&gt;wander along Jura’s wild coast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next Year&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddohnQ" title="Meall Corranaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Corranaich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8457/8016426722_a2928d8369_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach 182 Munros (i.e. 100 to go!) Mountains on my radar are the Far North Munros, the Fisherfield Munros, the rest of Knoydart and some of the big hills in the southwest such as Ben Cruachan and Ben Starav.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit an Island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete a continuous walk of more than 100 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp every month of the year (January may be tricky depending on the weather!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Sweeping across Europe from the sooty streets of Cambridge to the glistening great north faces of the Alps it is a tightly-plotted thriller revolving around a fierce climbing rivalry and the dawn of a new era as innovative technical equipment opens up the possibility of bold new routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/eiger.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the ups and downs of O. G. Jones, a gifted English climber at the forefront of the Progressive Mountaineering movement, the novel imagines a climbing world transformed by ice axes and crampons embraced many years earlier than in reality. This turns a new wave of mountain exploration into a bitter, dangerous battle between several young climbers eager to push the sport to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has a number of strengths and I particularly enjoyed the brisk plot, the cast of historical characters and the fascinating, flawed hero, O.G. Jones. Anyone with even a passing interest in the history of British mountaineering will recognise the names Collie, Raeburn and Crowley to name but three. The settings too will be familiar to anyone with a love of the mountains: the Clachaig in Glencoe and Wastdale Head in the Lake District being popular places in mountain lore then and now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descriptions of the locations and the feel for the climbing are particularly strong elements of the book. Alex brings to life the Victorian climbing establishment, filling the corners of the Clachaig with pipe smoke and laughter, and his descriptions of climbing in Scotland in particular convey an affinity with the high, wild places of the Highlands. One of my favourite passages from early on in the book reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stars burned steady out of the cold depths. This felt like a primal place where humans were not welcome; it belonged to atoms and frost, the slow turn of the heavens, and the ravages of geological time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical writing never gets bogged down in excessive detail, but rather dangles the reader in amongst the rock and ice of some iconic routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early chapters I struggled to get to grips with the female characters. They seemed at first vapid and inconsistent but as the story developed and the characters filled out these concerns were largely allayed. The strongest characterisations came towards the end of the book and the denouement was genuinely emotional. Whilst one or two of the early dramatic set pieces suffered slightly from excessive artistic license, I thought that the climax had a feel of true mountain mythos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of pleasing twists as the novel heads to its dramatic conclusion with Alex striking a good balance between moving the plot on and dwelling on the relationship between man and mountain and what risk means in such an uncaring and fatalistic environment. The final third of the book provides a fitting, thrilling denouement, uniting all the elements: believable characters, iconic settings and deft descriptions of climbers and their feelings out on the lonely rock-faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a confident piece of work that provides a thoroughly entertaining read from start to finish. With clear nods towards the likes of Harrer this is a book that will appeal to climbers and mountaineers but one that will also sit well with those interested in historical fiction and the quirks of Victorian society. I look forward to reading more from Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

In the well developed land of Great Britain, where tarmaced roads have been run to the furthest flung corners of the island, it is hard to get away from the marks of human civilisation. Fisherfield is one of the most isolated spots by this measure with the encircling roads failing to encroach on this unspoilt area of wild land.

&lt;p&gt;It is areas like this that draw me to the mountains of Scotland and after my time in Fisherfield a few weeks ago I was intrigued to know where the most remote hills lie. Places like Knoydart, Assynt and the Monadhliath come to mind, but what about specific hills? Luckily, a member of the Scottish Hills forum recently posted the results of an &lt;a href="http://www.scottishhills.com/html/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;amp;file=viewtopic&amp;amp;p=203686#203686"&gt;interesting exercise&lt;/a&gt;, adding a new twist to what we consider the most remote hills of Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Map of the Fisherfield Wilderness" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/fisherfield-map.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remoteness is typically determined by “as the crow flies” distances from things like roads. Doing this you can &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/scotland/725593/Scotland-The-remotest-place-in-Britain.html"&gt;determine that the remotest grid reference&lt;/a&gt; in the UK is a point around seven miles from the nearest piece of tarmac on the shoulder of Ruadh Stac Mor in Fisherfield at &lt;a href="http://www.streetmap.co.uk/map.srf?X=202020&amp;amp;Y=877000&amp;amp;A=Y&amp;amp;Z=120"&gt;NH02020 77000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this seems a rather meagre distance, the wild areas of the country are also generally the most rugged and this can turn a short straight line distance into quite a challenging journey, only doable on foot. In considering his definition of remoteness, the forum member took into account a measure of how long it takes to get somewhere if you are a walker. To arrive at his conclusions he estimated distance and ascent for a particular hill and then multiplied these figures by twelve minutes for every kilometre walked and twelve minutes for every 100m ascended. Doubling these he arrived at an approximate time for a round trip based on the closest/easiest route of ascent. His top ten is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the Knoydart Munros and Corbetts (with the exception of Ben Aden down near the bottom of the full list) do not make an appearance on this list as the possibility of catching a ferry from Mallaig to Inverie dramatically reduces the walking distance.

&lt;p&gt;This list interested me because over the last few months I have been on or near several of the summits in this top 38 list and have visited the summits of 14 of them in total. In March I &lt;a href="/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-day-1/"&gt;backpacked through the Atholl forest&lt;/a&gt; and bagged the remote Munros of Carn an Fhidlier (#5) and An Sgarsoch (#11) with their neighbouring Corbett Beinn Bhreac (#6); in May I &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/05/backpacking-the-attadale-hills-slowly/"&gt;backpacked around the western end of Loch Monar&lt;/a&gt; bagging Bidein a’ Choire Sheasgaich (#14) and Lurg Mhor (#8); and in June I travelled to Corrour station and &lt;a href="/blog/2012/06/travels-in-the-ben-alder-area-part-1/"&gt;backpacked around the Ben Alder group&lt;/a&gt; including Ben Alder (#10) and Beinn Bheoil (#2). Just last month I &lt;a href="/blog/2012/06/through-the-great-wilderness/"&gt;walked through Fisherfield&lt;/a&gt; which gave me views of A’ Mhaighdean (#4) and Ruadh Stac Mor (#3), Beinn Tarsuinn (#24) and Beinn Dearg Mor (#28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bVW8Fj" title="Loch Monar from the gully by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Monar from the gully" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7173903844_7ae9834bb0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fact remains that the most remote hill on the list, one of the Munros in Glen Affric (which I have seen from across the glen on Beinn Fiondlaidh (#18)) is only a long day walk away from a road, a ten hour round trip. It makes me think about the huge distances involved in Alaska or the Yukon where distance from a road is not measured in hours, but more often in days if not weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/8c5hiX" title="Summit of Beinn Fionnlaidh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn Fionnlaidh" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4018/4719814145_4750a7f86b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of wilderness is a strange thing. Backpacking has opened my eyes to solitude and isolation, to that feeling of being miles away from anywhere. In reality this is much more psychological than factual isolation. A wild camp last October besides the shores of Loch Einich felt wonderfully remote, despite being two hours from the car. This remoteness was a combination of lack of people and the wonderful autumnal weather which quite often had the peaks shrouded and mist drifting along the surface of the loch. Wrapped in your own world you could be a million miles from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/asYbGs" title="Clouds over Loch Einich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds over Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6239/6212402066_9627354740_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neverthless the list of remote hills provides plenty of inspiration for backpacking trips (and in fact only one of the hills I’ve bagged was done without involving a wild camp) so I think I know where I’ll be seeking inspiration for my next few trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how many of the remote hills listed here have you climbed and where have you &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; most isolated or most remote?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Spot Messenger 2 Review</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/07/spot-messenger-2-review/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-16T21:20:55+01:00</published><updated>2012-07-16T21:20:55+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-07-16:/blog/2012/07/spot-messenger-2-review/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t seem all that many years ago that only those people travelling to the far reaches of the world, places like the remote Himalaya or the Poles, had access to satellite communications technology.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spot in the wild" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-promo.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After seeing David Hine (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GridNorth"&gt;@gridnorth&lt;/a&gt;) and Colin Ibbotson (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tramplite"&gt;@tramplite&lt;/a&gt;) use their Spots with great success for various trips in Scotland (see David’s fabulous &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/google/GridNorth/West-Coast-Stravaig"&gt;West Coast Stravaig&lt;/a&gt; and Colin’s map for the &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/google/Tramplite/Moray-Coastal-Path"&gt;Moray Coastal Path&lt;/a&gt;), along with positive reports from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PhilOutdoors"&gt;Phil Turner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/user/profile/martin_free"&gt;Martin Free&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bryanwaddington"&gt;Bryan Waddington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andybryant"&gt;Andy Bryant&lt;/a&gt; (all of whom are Social Hikers), I decided that the &lt;strong&gt;Spot Satellite GPS Messenger&lt;/strong&gt; was something that would be useful to me, both now and for future trips, and so placed an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Buy A Satellite Communicator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I head into remote mountain areas to get away from the constant stream of 1s and 0s that seem to surround our every move these days, there are a few reasons why I decided to purchase a device capable of communicating without the need for a mobile signal (data or otherwise). These are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to let my family know where I am (and in particular where and when I have camped for the night) from any location.&lt;/strong&gt; Having a satellite communicator means I can send an “I’m ok” message not just from a Munro summit, but also if I camp down in a glen or other mobile reception blackspot. The ability to give my family reassurance of my wellbeing and that I am safely camped for the night was the primary motivator for purchasing the Spot device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to track a route over multiple days on one set of batteries.&lt;/strong&gt; My Garmin GPS which I use to track my hikes typically gets through a pair of AA batteries every 2-3 days if route recording is running. The Spot’s advertised battery life in tracking mode is around 10 days on 3xAAA batteries which should cover me for most trips and reduces carried weight if I do longer trips in the future. I plan to carry my GPS or Smartphone for navigation/grid ref checking but not to have it turned on for any great length of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to directly contact Mountain Rescue services with a precise location in the event that I am unable to make contact using my mobile phone.&lt;/strong&gt; I do most of my hiking solo and oftentimes I am away from well trodden routes. Having the ability to signal Mountain Rescue and have my GPS location transmitted to them directly could be invaluable in the event I get into real difficulties when out in the Highlands. Equally, I hope to be able to do future trips in more remote locales than Scotland (I’m thinking maybe Scandanavia, the USA and Greenland) and this service will be even more invaluable for those trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ability to share location and routes with other people either directly or via Social Hiking.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com"&gt;Social Hiking&lt;/a&gt; is a media rich mapping application that was originally designed for use with the Viewranger Buddy Beacon system as a source of live location data. Unfortunately Buddy Beacon relies on you having a 3G signal to transmit your location and this can be very limited in the Highlands. With Spot tracking, your Social Hiking map is updated every 10 minute irrespective of phone signal and I can choose whether to share publicly or privately using &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com"&gt;Social Hiking&lt;/a&gt; or Spot’s own live tracking website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Spot Satellite GPS Messenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the second version of the Spot device. The original Spot was launched a few years ago with the second iteration available from 2009. The Spot Satellite GPS Messenger is a compact, standalone unit which is well suited to backpacking trips. Spot also have another device called the &lt;a href="http://www.findmespot.com/en/index.php?cid=116"&gt;Spot Connect&lt;/a&gt; which pairs with your Smartphone and gives you more flexibility over message content. However, I try to use my phone as little as possible when out so decided the standalone unit better suited my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A comparison shot of a Spot messenger, Garmin GPS unit and a HTC smartphone" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-comparison2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit is reasonably compact, measuring 94x66x25 mm and weighs in at 120g with the three Lithium AAA batteries installed. It compares well to my Garmin GPS device and my Smartphone as shown above. Spot recommend mounting the unit facing directly up to the sky and I have found that I can slip it into the hydration tube strap on either my camping or day sack to achieve this (see below). The unit is supplied with a small case and strap designed to be worn as an armband but I prefer having it attached to my pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spot mounted on my rucksack" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-strapped.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit itself has a basic interface which I will describe more thoroughly below, but you configure and manage the device through the web interface provided at &lt;a href="www.findmespot.com"&gt;www.findmespot.com&lt;/a&gt;. This is where you activate the device, add services, define your messages and add contacts. Using the web interface you can also view a history of your tracking and messages and download these in various formats, including KML and GPX. The web interface also allows you to set up a map to share with friends and family (and it is this map that provides information to Social Hiking).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Spot Website" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-website-overview.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Subscriptions and Services&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the cost of the device itself, access to the Spot services requires payment of an annual subscription. This is currently 99 EURO for the basic service and you pay an additional 39 EURO to get access to the tracking services. With the weakened EURO this worked out at only a little over £110 for me for both the basic service and the tracking add-on. Of course the price you pay will be subject to the exchange rate at the time your card is processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the subscription service easy enough to step through, although the Spot website is a little fiddly to navigate at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to review the subscription in a years time but as I am currently going on more and more outings I believe the price is justified as it stands. Based on the trips I have already made in 2012, and looking forward to future plans, I anticipate spending 20-25 nights a year backpacking along with maybe 10-15 day trips around the country in a year. Based on this kind of usage the daily cost to me comes down to around £2.50. Everyone’s usage will be different and I certainly intend to review the value of the subscription when I come to renew next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my usage I feel that Tracking is a justifiable add-on, although some people manage perfectly well without it. &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/google/Paulm_/TGO-Challenge-My-Way"&gt;Paul M&lt;/a&gt; completed the TGO Challenge this year and kept his map updated by sending a check-in message at regular intervals, eliminating the need for the tracking add-on. Someone doing a very long hike may plan to only transmit their location once each day which will be adequate for tracking progress over the longer timescale and will save them on battery costs and weight. For me the tracking add-on is a convenience. I intend to use it as my primary method of tracking on longer outings and as the feature is unlimited I can use it to send off my location to Social Hiking on shorter trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Spot Satellite GPS Messenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spot 2 device is intended to be rugged and straight forward to use. It presents a basic interface comprising small, oval, recessed buttons and LEDs that flash either green or red. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I think I’m so conditioned to a world of touch screens and detailed feedback now that the very basic Spot interface actually took me a few moments to get to grips with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Spot" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-overview1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user inputs to Spot through the four buttons on the front of the unit. These lack positive feedback, especially when wearing thicker gloves or mitts, so I have gotten into the habit of holding them down for a count of 5 to make sure my press registers. I imagine that they are designed like this to reduce the likelihood of accidental activation but it would be good if they were just a little bit larger in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Spot device communicates its current mode and status to the user through flashing lights, one under each button, and a couple of additional lights for specific operations. These LEDs are not easily visible in direct sunlight but shading the unit with a hand is sufficient to see them. In overcast or dark conditions the LEDs are perfectly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot works on the basis of providing reassurance to the user. For as long as a function is active, the LED will flash away so it’s not a case of possibly missing a single or limited LED flash. Turn the unit on and the power LED flashes every second until you turn it off. Activate the tracking function and both the power LED and the tracking LED flash every second. The story is similar for the OK/Check-In and Custom functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two LEDs on the unit are used to indicate communications with the satellite, either that the unit is fetching the current location, or that a message is being transmitted. These LEDs flash red if there is a problem with either of the satellite operations so that you know something has failed and your message, location or both has not been successfully transmitted. These are important lights as there is no other form of feedback to tell you that your message has been sent or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first turned on the unit from cold with new batteries it seemed to take quite some time for it to successfully locate me and start transmitting messages. However, since that first time it has worked successfully and when I have had phone signal I have been able to check that the message was transmitted almost instantly after pressing the function button. I am now confident in Spot, though I highly recommend taking it on a test outing the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether this is an issue that will repeat once I change the batteries out. As I am out most weekends I have been leaving the batteries in the unit but this may not be optimal for the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also good to build Spot into your usual pre-walk routine, i.e. switch Spot on as soon as you get to your start point, set it down with a clear view of the sky, start tracking, and then send an ok/check-in message. Spot will then go through the process of getting its location, transmitting the check-in message and will then fall back into tracking mode. This can all be going on whilst you sort out your rucksack or have a bite to eat and then you can be on your way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When out I have typically been sending an ok/check-in message when setting out, and then when I stop for a break on a summit or for lunch. At the end of the day I stop tracking and then send a custom message to indicate that I am setting up camp. At this point I let the unit go through the full send message cycle whilst I am putting up the tent and sorting dinner and then I switch the unit off for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Field Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve now used Spot for three different trips so this is by no means a comprehensive report, and certainly does not address reliability of the unit or battery life at present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/06/here-we-go-mistaking-clouds-for-mountains/"&gt;short day trip&lt;/a&gt; I found Spot of limited use, especially as my route involved a lot of forest walking. In this environment some of the track points failed to register and coupled with my fast pace the resulting track was inaccurate and incomplete. However, it did rain for the whole 3.5 hours and with the Spot exposed it seemed that the watertightness of the unit was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/bVUow4" title="The summit of Sgòr Gaibhre by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The summit of Sgòr Gaibhre" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/7173563543_e952640e39_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/06/travels-in-the-ben-alder-area-part-1/"&gt;three day trip through the Ben Alder mountains&lt;/a&gt; I found the Spot excellent. I used it to update my friends and family on progress through the day and sent a final ok/check-in when I got to camp. I used the custom message to let them know I was back at the car. Spot also bounced these to Twitter where the Spot map was appended to the message. The family members who received the messages where happy to know of my progress and wellbeing. For future backpacking trips I’m going to use the custom message to check-in from camp at the end of the day, rather than sending another ok/check-in message as this is less ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I had my Spot turned on for a recent &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/06/through-the-great-wilderness/"&gt;trip through Fisherfield&lt;/a&gt;. This was primarily to &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/os/nickbramhll/Corrie-Hallie-to-Kinlochewe-The-Midnight-Walk"&gt;update my Social Hiking map&lt;/a&gt;, and to test that the recently implemented tie-in to the auto-tweeting feature of Social Hiking was working, and this proved successful. I can now use the ok/check-in message and Social Hiking will Tweet on my behalf and append a link to my Social Hiking map. As Social Hiking uses Ordnance Survey mapping it is better than the Spot map which uses topographic data similar to that found in Google or Bing maps. The only slight concern on this trip was that I set Spot down at the end of the walk to send a custom message indicating we had finished. This message never transmitted although I didn’t notice any red LEDs flashing on the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Updated Spot Field Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OK/Check-In Messages and Custom Messages&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I haven’t been keeping a full track of my messages to determine exactly what has been sent or not but I do know of two specific instances of my Custom Message not being received. One of these was at Kinlochewe where where I left the Spot on the ground next to our coach in a shady car park. The second was when camping in a gorge besides the River Carnach. I suspect in both cases the unit struggled to send the message, despite my putting the Spot in as exposed a position as possible. My thoughts are that when restricted the unit can struggle to locate a satellite in the area of sky available and so the message is not transmitted successfully. I have now adopted a system of sending two Custom messages at the end of day hoping to increase the probability of a message getting through. On my most recent overnighter this resulted in both Custom messages getting through to recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I was securing the Spot to my shoulder straps using the hydration tubing tethers, however, after a suggestion from Andy Bryant I have now started putting the device into my rucksack’s top pocket. In both examples (my small Haglofs daypack and my larger Osprey camping pack) this hasn’t had an adverse effect on tracking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the Spot exclusively to track my progress over 4 days in the Northwest Highlands and on review found that the only major gap in coverage was in two cases where I was walking in dense woodland. I am now more than happy to keep the Spot in the top pocket. It should be noted that for sending ok and custom messages I am taking the Spot out of the top pocket and putting it flat on the ground with a clear view of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Green has &lt;a href="http://www.briangreen.net/2012/09/spot-ii-gps-messenger-disappointment.html"&gt;posted about a recent negative experience with Spot&lt;/a&gt; and this has resulted in numerous other commentators airing grievances about poor message delivery success. I would say that in my experience the Spot has been largely (&amp;gt;90%) successful and I certainly haven’t had a problem where messages were delayed. They have either been delivered almost instantly in most cases, or not at all in a small minority of instances. I will continue to monitor Spot and have now adjusted my messages slightly to suit conversations with those who are receiving them. This should ensure that a missed message doesn’t immediately start rescue actions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations of the Spots tracking are largely only apparent on shorter trips. The ten minute gap, particularly if a couple of the transmissions are interrupted for some reason (e.g. being in a dense forest) can mean a significant portion of your track is missing. Spot does retain the last two positions and transmits these but if the problem was obtaining GPS lock in the first place then this doesn’t help. The ten minute interval also means that your track  can be dramatically smoother than the going actually was on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spot tracking (on the left) produces a less accurate track than my GPS device (on the right)" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/spot-gps-comparison.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally Spot does not know or record elevation data and so you have to go through and add this in later if you wish to produce an elevation profile or calculate total ascent based on only the Spot tracking data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These limitations are understandable in the context of Spot and the way it works and I am happy as I can still use my GPS to record a detailed track on shorter trips whilst using the Spot for longer adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other, and perhaps more important limitation of Spot, is the lack of direct communication back to you. The Spot is an all or nothing device. You either initiate a rescue, or you don’t. Happily in my time walking in the hills I have never had to contact Mountain Rescue and certainly wouldn’t contact them for something trivial, but the knowledge that pressing SOS on the Spot starts a potentially unstoppable chain of events will certainly make me cautious about using it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same also applies to the Help button which sends a pre-defined help message to your contacts. Again, this must be used with caution as the message is fixed and one way. I currently have this set-up to indicate that my progress has been hampered or my route has been changed significantly and that I will try and contact home via mobile within the next 2 hours. Hopefully this makes it a useful feature and again, doesn’t unnecessarily initiate a chain of unstoppable events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the Spot deliberately has a good deal of redundancy built into its processes and I am happy with anecdotal reports I have read of other users. Obviously there is no option to “test” the SOS function but Spot have reported a number of successful rescues being routed through their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Hiking and Live Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration with the media-rich live mapping website &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com"&gt;Social Hiking&lt;/a&gt; is very good. Instructions on how to use Spot are available through &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/blog/2012/04/22/setting-up-social-hiking-for-the-tgo-challenge/"&gt;Social Hiking’s documentation&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that it took a short while for Social Hiking to recognise my Spot map. I assume this was to do with the Spot end refreshing its database or generating the public feed but am not entirely sure. Suffice it to say after a few minutes the error message that appeared in the Social Hiking interface disappeared and I had confirmation that my Spot map was correctly configured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="https://twitter.com/nickbramhll/status/216501185602011136" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/sh-tweet.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Spot tracking throughout my Ben Alder trip and on returning home found that I had an excellent recorded track. I also was able to see that Social Hiking had tweeted the start of my map each day. A new feature that has recently been rolled out means that whenever I send an ok/check-in message my Social Hiking map will get amended to give context to the check-in. The above Tweet was sent towards the end of my walk through Fisherfield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the site might appear overwhelming at first, thanks to a robust search feature getting to the right information is generally straight forward. If you have an an Ordnance Survey grid reference you can type this in directly to Geograph and view photos taken of “features” within that square kilometre. As well as going to specific squares you can also search for features or place names which works well for rivers and hills. Features can be almost anything: from the land itself, through rivers and lakes, to buildings or gates. This can be a valuable tool to look for recent photos of remote bridges or bothies, or to look at the conditions of paths, but for me one of the best uses has been checking out the suitability of an area for wild camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2012 04 25 at 22 18 42" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/geograph-search.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my most recent trip across the Grampian Mountains I was looking to camp on the Corbett Beinn Mheadhonach. The Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 map reveals a good saddle of land between the main summit and the northern top. Using Geograph I put in the grid reference and was able to see immediately that the area wasn’t a complete mess of bog, or a boulder field, and so felt pretty confident about finding a suitable pitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve done the same when looking at camping in a glen besides a river to check for dryish land or up on summit ridges to check that the terrain has some flatness to it. Geograph probably won’t guide you to the exact site you’ll pitch your tent (after all, half the fun is rolling about in the heather trying to find the least lumpy spot) but it may give you some confidence that you will find somewhere in that locality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the site is only as good as the uploaded photos. If you are browsing around and notice an empty or under-photographed square on your route then maybe make a note to take a photo of that area for the site whilst you are passing through. I wouldn't expect people to give up that super secret camp site or bothy that they’ve been returning to for years, but even general views of areas can be very helpful for trip planning. I've recently uploaded my &lt;a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/2916948"&gt;first photos&lt;/a&gt; to the site - adding to three squares that were without photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2012 04 28 at 11 05 38" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/geograph-photo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note also that Geograph operates under a Creative Commons license; everything on the site can be reused as long as it is attributed and the other conditions of the licensing are observed. If you are a photographer this means you must release your photo under that license (though the copyright of course remains yours). This does mean that Geograph photos can quite often turn up in Wikipedia articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, whilst Geograph have been sponsored by the Ordanance Survey up until now, it looks like that deal will be ending soon and so to continue running and developing the site Geograph are considering different ways of raising funds, from subscriptions to advertising and more. They have a very detailed survey to get some insight from users and visitors on how they might want to see funding working so if you have an interest in the project it would be worth taking a few minutes to &lt;a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/discuss/index.php?&amp;amp;action=vthread&amp;amp;forum=1&amp;amp;topic=14850&amp;amp;page=0"&gt;fill it in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="geography"></category><category term="photography"></category><category term="technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Atholl Forest and Western Cairngorms Traverse (Overview)</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-overview/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-25T01:01:52+00:00</published><updated>2012-03-25T01:01:52+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-03-25:/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-overview/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As befits a three day wander across the Grampian Mountains this is going to be a long report, so I have decided to split it up a little.

This first post will serve as a summary and may really be all you want to read (if you also take a look at the slideshows over on Flickr). The in-depth accounts for each day are linked towards the bottom and follow this post in chronological order, one for each day. It was a fantastic trip, definitely my favourite yet, helped by great weather, a pleasingly ambitious route and brilliant scenery. I really hope you enjoy the photos and report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7031000273"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7031000273_2472f4f07c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last few circular walks, the plan this time was to do a through route making use of public transport. A classic route, reported &lt;a href="http://blogpackinglight.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/blair-atholl-to-aviemore/"&gt;on by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://saharanscot.travellerspoint.com/15/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.christownsendoutdoors.com/2011/09/autumn-issue-of-tgo-out-now.html"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, is Blair Atholl to the Aviemore (or &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/aviemoor-to-blair-atholl-route-2.html"&gt;vice-versa&lt;/a&gt;) by way of Glen Tilt, Glen Dee and the Lairig Ghru. This is a great route in its own right, with spectacular mountain scenery and a great feeling of wilderness. However, it misses out the tops and I was keen to add to my tally of Munros and Corbetts. I have only a handful of remaining Munros east of the A9, and conveniently six of them sat between Blair Atholl and Aviemore, so I devised a plan to bag them all in one long, somewhat winding, through route.  To make the traverse work I briefly considered leaving a car at one end and using the train to get back to it, but the more I looked at the train times the more it made sense just to use the train for the full round. Thus I ended up travelling from Aberdeen to Blair Atholl via Perth on Friday, walking across the hills to Aviemore, and then caught the train back to Aberdeen via Inverness on Sunday evening. It did mean that I got home just before midnight on Sunday but luckily the buzz from the trip got me through an early start at work on the Monday morning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7027937391"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7239/7027937391_f6fb49365c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The route&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My route can be viewed &lt;a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/routes/report-card.php?year=2012&amp;amp;tripid=006"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Blair Atholl I went up Glen Tilt to the Munro of Carn a’ Chlamain. I then went west and camped near the summit of the Corbett Beinn Mheadhonach. The next day I continued west to the second Munro of Beinn Dearg and then turned north to the Corbett Beinn Bhreac. From here I followed the boundary line along a series of rounded hills to the Tarf Munros, Carn an Fhidleir and An Sgarsach, before dropping down to camp by the river Feshie on Saturday evening. On the Sunday I followed the river Eidart up onto the western Cairngorm plateau, went over the Munro Mullach Clach a’ Bhlair and then headed north across the Great Moss to the sixth and final Munro of Sgor Gaoith. I then followed the hills on the west side of Glen Einich before dropping down into the Rothiemurchas Forest, following various tracks past Loch an Eilein, and finally making it to Aviemore and the station there. The total distance was just over 52 miles and my GPS recorded around 11,000 feet of vertical ascent. I was on the move for a total of a little under 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The photo highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all the usual stuff this time around, with perhaps one notable exception. After my &lt;a href="http://pacoutdoor.com/sleeping-pads/view/peak-elite-ac"&gt;POE Peak Elite AC&lt;/a&gt; deflated continually during the night on my last trip in February, I contacted customer services to see about that &lt;a href="http://pacoutdoor.com/support/warranty"&gt;lifetime guarantee&lt;/a&gt; of theirs. Unfortunately, despite a few follow up e-mails I haven’t heard anything from them yet. Not wanting to take my bulky Prolite, I ended up ordering an &lt;a href="http://www.exped.com/exped/web/exped_homepage_na.nsf/0/48E15F320AFDC7EDC125767E00705EC7?opendocument"&gt;Exped Synmat UL 7&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.ultralightoutdoorgear.co.uk/"&gt;Ultralight Outdoor Gear&lt;/a&gt; which was delivered very speedily and in time to take on the trip. I used this both nights and it was a revelation. I actually found the POE very comfy, and my only complaint really was the mummy outline which meant it was easy for my sleeping-bag-entombed legs to slide sideways off the mat in the night. The rectangular outline of the Synmat largely overcomes this problem and overall I found the mat extremely comfortable (for both back and side sleeping) and warm (though the conditions weren’t anything particularly testing). The advertised weight of 460g was spot on so it is a little heavier and takes up slightly more room in the pack than the POE. To be honest though, the benefits of comfort and additional width actually make up for this. I just hope it turns out to be more durable than the short-lived POE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6872608916"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping besides the Feshie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7250/6872608916_036fb86ff0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After suffering from slow, inefficient boil times with my meths stove last time (due to snowmelt and low river temperatures) I went back to gas for this trip and happily got back into having boiling hot water for drinks and meals within a couple of minutes rather than twenty. This is really a convenience thing more than anything but I’ll definitely be using meths again in the future as I love the quiet simplicity of the Caldera Cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021765007"&gt;&lt;img alt="The long ridge to Carn a' Chlamain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7119/7021765007_10164f3aea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that I was lucky in that for late March, at Munro height, I didn’t need any winter kit and in fact came across very little residual snow. This same weekend a year ago my girlfriend and I almost got snowed in whilst spending a weekend in Killin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030953675"&gt;&lt;img alt="Collapsing snowbanks on the Caochan Dubh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7224/7030953675_1de81b7f31_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of weight for the trip, my base weight came in at around 6.6kg. I took a lot of food which brought up the total pack weight (also including fuel (60g) and water (500g) to 8.7kg. Once my worn clothes and poles were added in I ended up with a total skin-out weight of 10.9kg. You can view my kit list by viewing or downloading &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B19qDwvSzsMCNnk2SFBIb2gtMGc"&gt;this PDF file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has walked in this area (and the popularity of Eas Dé (known as the Linn) and the Central Cairngorms means that this will be many) the website is a trove of wonderful knowledge, photos and history and well worth spending some time exploring. It has sketch maps (with corrected place names), photographs, videos, articles on geological features, as well as critical reviews of books that concern themselves with the area, such as the writings of the Scottish naturalist &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seton_Gordon"&gt;Seton Gordon&lt;/a&gt;, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though now largely owned by the &lt;a href="http://www.nts.org.uk/Property/Mar-Lodge-Estate/"&gt;National Trust for Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, the upland of Mar was a former vast estate owned by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Fife"&gt;Earls Fife&lt;/a&gt; and has an interesting history both where human habitation is concerned, and in terms of the geology, with the landscape still bearing the scars of ice age glaciation. The website is concerned with all corners of this part of the country; from the River Dé through to the ruins of places like Geldie Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book which has been titled &lt;em&gt;Lowdown on the upland of Mar&lt;/em&gt; is a distilled version, a field guide, that brings together the detailed information contained within the website. As such, if you are familiar with the content of the website, then you will find much of the same material repeated in the book. Joe principally structures the book by following major geographic features, the rivers and glens of the region, pursuing each one as it cuts its course into the high Cairngorm mountains. He covers prominent features - including farms, shielings and lodges; the rivers, streams and lochs; and bridges and dams - tracing their course and development through historical writings taken from a diverse range of sources, as well as more recent scholarly studies. Historical maps, including the first Ordnance Survey maps of the area are also referred to. Using these he builds up a rich and detailed picture of this fascinating part of Scotland that many hillwalkers, mountain bikers and climbers will be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6659806525"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_3937.JPG" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6659806525_7d30e6859a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe has chosen to publish the book via &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kindle-Store"&gt;Amazon's Kindle platform&lt;/a&gt;, though you don't actually need a Kindle to read it (Amazon provide apps for several of the major operating systems and mobile platforms). The ebook is just over 100 pages long and includes a selection of photographs and illustrations from the website, the reproduction of which is good on my 3rd generation Kindle (see the photos accompanying this review). Whilst the sketch maps are in black and white, the clarity is excellent and the black and white photographs are clear enough to provide illustration for the book. Full colour, higher resolution versions of the maps and &lt;a href="http://theuplandofmar.squarespace.com/days-on-the-hill/"&gt;photographs&lt;/a&gt; are available on the website should you need better reproduction, as well as in the Kindle desktop and mobiles versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6659770329"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_3935.JPG" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6659770329_0d3f86e31c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it is primarily intended to be used as a guide whilst out walking and exploring in the area, the book itself makes a good stand-alone read. It includes an interesting introduction as well as notes on some of the Scots and Gaelic language used throughout. As an avid Cairngorm wanderer, I am familiar with many of the places covered by Joe's book, and I enjoyed discovering more of the history of the area including some entertaining "tall tales" associated with people and places. I feel that even those who aren't familiar with the area, but who enjoy the history of people and places, would gain something from reading this book, particularly if they have the OS map spread out in front of them to follow the contours of the land. It is a book as much about local history as it is about local landscape. It does however concern itself with the minutiae of the area, and details individual crofts and side streams as they are encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6659789109"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_3936.JPG" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7018/6659789109_78c1cf1329_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is well written with Joe easily combining different sources, as well as his own voice, to create a coherent narrative and the only area of criticism is that often the lists of place names and translations get to be a little repetitive (though this is symptomatic of Gaelic place names in general, rather than anything Joe has done). As with any Kindle book it is somewhat time-consuming to flick back and foreword to refer to the maps. I have found it easier to read the book either in conjunction with the website, or with the relevant OS map to hand. Though arguably the same content is largely available on the website, it is nice to have it presented in a book-format where the information flows naturally from one area to the next without the constant clicking that website navigation involves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did come across a couple of strange formatting issues (titles spread across a couple of pages) which I have let Joe know about and which should should be addressed in the next revision of the book (that is, if they are a widespread issue and not just confined to my own copy). These do not detract from reading the book and I have come across no issues with the text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2856132122/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Dee" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3150/2856132122_c47cdc58bd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are interested in purchasing your own copy of &lt;em&gt;Lowdown on the upland of Mar&lt;/em&gt;, or trying out a sample chapter, then please go to &lt;a href="http://theuplandofmar.squarespace.com/lowdown-on-the-upland-of-mar/"&gt;Joe's website&lt;/a&gt; which has links to the book's page on both &lt;em&gt;Amazon.co.uk&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently the ebook retails for £7.99 on Amazon.co.uk and Joe notes on the website that proceeds from the sale of the book supports the continuing research into history and geography of the upland of Mar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a footnote I must admit that I am as guilty as anyone else of simply repeating the Anglicised and corrupted spellings used by the Ordnance Survey on their maps. My blog reports cover the Lairig Ghru (Làirig Dhrù), Glen Lui (Glen Laoigh), Glen Ey (Glen Eidh), the River Dee (Dé) and many, many more. Reading this book has made me want to try and improve this aspect going forward, as well as revisiting old reports to get the names right!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book review"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="kindle"></category></entry><entry><title>2011 in the Scottish Hills</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/12/2011-in-the-scottish-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-28T16:50:58+00:00</published><updated>2011-12-28T16:50:58+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-12-28:/blog/2011/12/2011-in-the-scottish-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As 2011 draws to a close and the weather is wild and windy outside, I thought it a good opportunity to browse back through the reports and photos from my trips out in the Scottish hills over the past twelve months and put together a quick summary.

&lt;p&gt;After a great 2011 which featured some very enjoyable trips I’m already looking forward to 2012 with plans to extend my trips into multi-day routes, and with hopes and dreams of getting into Knoydart, to Fisherfield and returning to the Far North (a post I still have to finish). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blog mainly for my own sake but am always incredibly pleased and humbled when people take the time to leave a comment or retweet a photo on Twitter, so thank you to everyone who has taken a look at my posts and photos this year, and especially to those who have left a comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5542146221/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Southern Highlands" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5134/5542146221_bf2ac2808d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hill Bagging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 was a little disappointing in terms of new Munros climbed, although my focus has turned more to wild camping and exploring the hills. Nevertheless, my aim at the start of the year had been to get to the half way point of my round (142) - as it stands I have only made it to 115.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5320732300/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow storms over Lochnagar" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5244/5320732300_c3358ed675_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5400772336/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow storm" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5255/5400772336_3ffb115733_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5487094624/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Callater" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5173/5487094624_c778666057_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed 15 new Munros in 2011 but also did a good number of repeats, revisiting some favourite peaks, and finished the year with a total of 29 Munros climbed. Of the new Munros my favourites were the &lt;a href="/blog/2011/05/north-glen-shiel-ridge-overnighter/"&gt;Five Sisters above Kintail&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/blog/2011/11/ben-lawers-or-the-clouds-lie-below-coire-nan-cat/"&gt;Lawers range&lt;/a&gt; in Perthshire which I headed to on two separate occasions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6327261400/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Corranaich" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6215/6327261400_9401d92298_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5676832684/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Domhain surrounded by the Five Sisters" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5226/5676832684_de53ed7279_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition I really enjoyed finally getting to the top of &lt;a href="/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-part-1/"&gt;Carn an Righ&lt;/a&gt;, a fabulously remote mountain in the Grampians, south of Braemar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5640933287/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn an Righ" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5058/5640933287_7713b00e5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5699304432/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Dee" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2129/5699304432_96b9fab643_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the biggest disappointment was yet again climbing to the top of &lt;a href="/blog/2011/10/glen-einich-and-braeriach-wild-camp/"&gt;Braeriach in mist and rain&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps in 2012 I can finally get a view from this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the other hill categories I did quite a few Grahams this year, and added a batch of new Corbetts. Of these &lt;a href="/blog/2011/03/across-the-ochils/"&gt;Ben Cleuch in the Ochils&lt;/a&gt; was the high point of a fantastic winter’s walk near Stirling, whilst the round of the &lt;a href="/blog/2011/06/the-strathconon-corbetts/"&gt;two Strathconon Corbetts&lt;/a&gt; was a real challenge with high winds, rain and snow - not bad for the end of May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5551735602/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ascent of Ben Cleuch" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5017/5551735602_fc68762793_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5795859357/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Strathconon, rain clearing" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5070/5795859357_2e1fec4e54_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A memorable moment early on in the year was standing on top of &lt;a href="/blog/2011/02/the-callater-haute-route/"&gt;Carn na Drochaide above Loch Callater&lt;/a&gt; in a whiteout that cleared to give an amazing winter evening, the sun blushing the snow and the views north to the Cairngorms being superb. Although the weather was less amenable, the Hogmany Hoolie up the &lt;a href="/blog/2011/01/the-coyles-of-muick/"&gt;Coyles of Muick&lt;/a&gt; certainly blew out a few cobwebs with great views to Lochnagar and Glen Muick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5323931098/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Frozen Loch Muick" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5209/5323931098_d21290509d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the days that didn’t feature hills, my girlfriend and I had a really good day doing a round of Loch Kinord and a stretch of the Deeside Way. It was a beautiful summery day and worked out really well as a relaxed wander. We also finally got our outdoor barbeque sorted for my birthday, enjoying the delights of Loch Lee on another blustery but sunny day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5654822331/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trees and sky" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5183/5654822331_2081d30f08_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5971145892/"&gt;&lt;img alt="West end of Loch Lee" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6148/5971145892_f27d393b14_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wild Camping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my single successful wild camp in 2010 I wanted to try and get out camping every month between April and October in 2011, a total aim of seven wild camps. I made it just over halfway towards this target, taking the tent out in April (twice), June and October. Each of these trips was memorable for different reasons and are summarised briefly below in both words and pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5636006596/"&gt;&lt;img alt="North towards the Cairngorms" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5103/5636006596_c184f50a1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5628331511/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5066/5628331511_ac333213ac_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5640917553/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sock Drying Weather" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5010/5640917553_dac8c9bf75_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5640954565/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cornice on Beinn Iutharn Mhor" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5025/5640954565_a9c2067832_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-part-1/"&gt;trip to Carn an Righ&lt;/a&gt; was a great route walked under magical conditions with a great campsite besides a bubbling river below the very remote Munro that had brought me to this quiet corner of the Grampians. I really enjoyed the great path alongside the infant river Tilt as well as the grand views of the snow-rimmed Cairngorms. The next morning under unblemished blue skies I headed up Carn an Righ and then enjoyed a wonderfully relaxed bimble back to the car via Carn Iutharn Mor and Glen Ey. I had a good chat with some visitors from America and came across my first ever Scottish adder. Though the full moon had washed out the stars those few minutes spent in the cold, cold early morning air were some of the best moments of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5686496126/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr a' Bhealaich Dheirg" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5186/5686496126_e014d32353_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5673622254/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping on the Five Sisters" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5062/5673622254_3562db10c1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5685961967/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dawn hits the South Shiel Ridge" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5295/5685961967_05d43a14af_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5674862801/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching Sgurr nan Saighead" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5109/5674862801_00643f52e1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5676294297/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Shiel" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5190/5676294297_77cf885368_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second trip in April took me along the &lt;a href="/blog/2011/05/north-glen-shiel-ridge-overnighter/2"&gt;entire North Clunie/Shiel ridge&lt;/a&gt; including a camp near the summit of the first of the Five Sisters of Kintail. Whilst the weather was hot and sunny the wind played much more of a factor this time and in fact that night was quite restless with the tent (a Scarp 1 obtained from Martin Rye) taking quite a battering. I do have great memories of eating my dinner looking out to Skye and Knoydart as the sun sank into a ruddy haze. Although the plan had been to continue on for another night and day and return via the South Shiel ridge the restless night had left me exhausted and the rivers were very dry causing me to bail out at Shiel Bridge. Nevertheless it was a glorious ridge-walk in some of the best Scottish landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5825629944/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camp above Loch Avon" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5154/5825629944_6c5f273a9d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5845797366/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunrise over Loch Avon" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2690/5845797366_290c008661_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5843155773/"&gt;&lt;img alt="A small tent in a big world" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2742/5843155773_4bea55a68c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5845481803/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Gorm and Strath Nethy" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5023/5845481803_9496609c9d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5846045290/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds creeping over Ben MacDui" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2585/5846045290_2f0ff747b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5845580953/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Angel's Peak" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5186/5845580953_2093502689_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By June, heat waves and wildfires had melted away under rain and dark skies. Eventually a decent weekend presented itself (albeit the good weather was forecast for Sunday morning) so I &lt;a href="/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter/"&gt;trekked around to Cairn Gorm&lt;/a&gt; and walked in across the plateau to Shelter Stone crag. I pitched the tent with views looking over Loch Avon as the rain turned swiftly to snow. The next morning dawned with clear blue skies and I was able to wander over and bag Beinn Mheadhoin before returning to the car via Ben MacDui as the clouds once again gathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6209044398/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge over the Am Beanaidh" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6192/6209044398_c5cdcd7c13_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6203871389/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camp besides Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6178/6203871389_ac0f083e1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6212374818/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6111/6212374818_d6ed5831b2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6205082258/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6172/6205082258_2d758f3598_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6205220310/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Forest colours" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6133/6205220310_3da931174d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lacklustre September I was determined to get out in October, no matter the weather. I wasn't sure I had done quite the right thing after spending forty-five minutes sitting in the car at Whitewell as rain thrummed off the car's windshield. Eventually it abated and &lt;a href="/blog/2011/10/glen-einich-and-braeriach-wild-camp/"&gt;I walked up to Loch Einich&lt;/a&gt; were a spent a calm night in the tent. The next day the cloud was low so I returned to the car via Braeriach, the Lairig Ghru and a damp and dripping Rothiemurchas forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Wild Camping Gear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my trip in April I took up a great opportunity to purchase a TarpTent Scarp 1. Whilst this tent is a bit heavier than the Terra Nova Laser Competition I was using, it offsets this by being much roomier, particular lengthways which is important when you are 6”5’. It is a brilliant design, stable in high winds, able to deal with snow and rain, and one that maximises internal space to give you a decent level of liveability. I sold on my Laser Comp to &lt;a href="http://atkypne.blogspot.com/"&gt;Alex Atkinson&lt;/a&gt; who has had some brilliant trips with it down in the Lake District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5845821360/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tarptent Scarp 1 and Ben MacDui" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5302/5845821360_b9c63a8e66_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally retired a four year old, very battered pair of North Face trail shoes and replaced them with a pair of inov-8 Terroc 315 shoes. I’ve used these for most of my hillwalking this year and they have been great. They are lightweight, quick to dry and super comfortable even over significant mileage and ascent. Teamed with Sealskinz for colder conditions they have been used since the snow disappeared in April and will probably only be left at home once I’m back in my Scarpa Mantas for winter hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5872968321/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Caldera Cone Stove System" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5061/5872968321_6ed0220b0c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added to my list of options an alcohol stove setup (as well as backing the second batch of &lt;a href="http://www.theboilerwerks.com/"&gt;Backcountry Boilers&lt;/a&gt;, which I am still waiting on) going with the lightweight Caldera Cone. I took this on my Loch Einich trip and really enjoyed the simplicity, efficiency and ease of use. I’ll be continuing to use both alcohol and gas next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started using Fuizion Freeze Dried Foods which were a revelation. They prove that dehydrated food doesn’t have to be horrible, tasteless and textureless. They’ve also just announced free UK mainland postage which addresses the main gripe that people had with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abroad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6063247478/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lunch stop by the Spokane River" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6080/6063247478_f4bd2d1a27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to make a change from all the tramping around in the Scottish rain I took a &lt;a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2011/09/the-spokane-centennial-trail/"&gt;bike ride through the Spokane River valley&lt;/a&gt; in Eastern Washington State whilst on a trip to the Pacific Northwest, and finally wrote up a &lt;a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2011/11/the-rakiura-track-a-new-zealand-overnighter/"&gt;trip along the Rakiura Track&lt;/a&gt; down at the very south of the New Zealand archipelago which I tramped back in August 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/6074262333/"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_9858.JPG" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6074/6074262333_419c2c7897_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the most remarkable thing about 2011 was the awfulness of the weather. After a prolonged and really quite hot early spring, culminating in wild fires that swept through Torridon and Kintail at the end of April, from May there was a rapid descent into wet, windy and wild weather. It caught TGO Challenge people out on the infamous &lt;a href="http://www.scotweather.co.uk/swblog/blogs/blog2.php/23rd-may-2011-storm-what"&gt;May 23rd storm&lt;/a&gt; and this trend returned later in the year with both October, November and December being very wild indeed. With milder autumn temperatures I was hoping to extend my wild camping into November but unfortunately almost constant forecasts of gale force winds in the mountains put me off taking the tent and I ended up just doing daywalks in November. December had its ups and downs with snow around the middle of the month but milder temperatures returning for the festive period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other People’s Trips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People continued to report some fantastic trips on their own blogs this year providing inspiration and jealousy in equal measures. Of those with a Scottish flavour a favourite was James Boulter's &lt;a href="http://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/bothy-vagabonds-in-the-far-north-pt3-assynt/"&gt;trip to the far north&lt;/a&gt;, hopping from bothy to bothy and exploring wild glens and moors, which made for a superb three part read. Martin Rye did a great trip from &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/10/aviemoor-to-blair-atholl-route-2.html"&gt;Aviemore to Blair Athol&lt;/a&gt; and Fraser McAlister had some &lt;a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2011/07/25/loch-aan-high-winds-and-tent-failure/"&gt;wild weather in the Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;. The TGO Challengers met with some pretty tough May weather and &lt;a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2011/05/tgo-challenge-2011/"&gt;I’ve updated my blog on the subject&lt;/a&gt; to cover reports and blogs from those who participated. Petesy pulled his usual stunning trips out of the bag including &lt;a href="http://www.petesy.co.uk/race-day/"&gt;this one to Fisherfield&lt;/a&gt; which has definitely whetted my appetite for a trip there next year. Ness seems to do fantastic backpacking trips on a regular basis and her &lt;a href="http://ness64.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/munro-bagging-in-the-southern-eastern-cairngorms/"&gt;wander through the Grampians&lt;/a&gt; is still being written up. Colin Ibbotson managed a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMm8ENuoZ9k"&gt;fantastic packrafting trip around Loch Mullardoch&lt;/a&gt; despite the changeable November weather whilst Steven Horner enjoyed a stunning cloud inversion as &lt;a href="http://www.stevenhorner.com/?p=1540"&gt;part of a big walk&lt;/a&gt; through the Cairngorms. Ben wrote a fantastic, catch-all &lt;a href="http://benvironment.org.uk/post/12836890780/camping"&gt;post on the joys of camping&lt;/a&gt; with lots of great photos whilst David H showed how to do pack rafting in style with &lt;a href="http://gridnorth.blogspot.com/2011/10/backpacking-packrafting-in-torridon.html"&gt;this trip around Torridon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the UK there were some incredible trips including &lt;a href="http://dzjow.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/greenland-2009-part-i-tasermiut-fjord/"&gt;this one around Greenland&lt;/a&gt;, whilst David Lintern’s &lt;a href="http://www.selfpowered.net/2011/12/haute-route-highlights.html"&gt;crossing of the Pyrenees&lt;/a&gt; and Maz’s trip around the &lt;a href="http://www.journeymantraveller.com/2011/09/classic-haute-route-days-1-2-chamonix.html"&gt;Classic Haute Route&lt;/a&gt; in the Alps are well worth setting aside rainy afternoons to read and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gear Highlights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the wild camping gear highlighted above I didn’t buy a great deal of normal gear this year, choosing instead to get some more experience with my existing stuff. What I did buy was a success, particularly the Rab Vapour-Rise Jacket. Purchased at the end of February I wore this non-stop for both hillwalks and commuting. It is a fantastically versatile jacket, comfy, warm and able to fend off most that the weather can hurl at you (besides driving rain). The only criticism is that it is looking a little worn around the shoulder and waist strap areas which is disappointing for 10 months use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the introduction I have a few ambitious plans for next year, including turning my overnighters into multi-day treks taking in some of the more remote areas of the country, as well as a desire to visit some of the more dramatic parts of the North West Highlands and the Far North. I'll be continuing to write this blog and enjoying reading about other people's adventures. There seems to have been a tipping point somewhere in the last few months and it feels that blogs and digital media are now more useful and relevant than traditional magazines etc. In fact I haven't bought a single magazine this year though I continue to enjoy reading books about the outdoors and particularly the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

The city recedes in my mirrors. Head west into the low afternoon sun. Negotiate the muddy and pot-holed road and park. Laces tied, sack on, straight off into the forest. Mulchy, muddy ground under foot, blue skies above broken by white clouds racing through on a strong breeze. The gloomy forest smells of decay and the end of the year. Toadstools grow on mossy banks in the shadow of tall pine trees. The path climbs steadily, skirting the hill. Pass a young family out enjoying the fresh air. Clouds sculpted into spaceships hang low in the late afternoon light. A pause for the view and then head to the boulder. Hand over hand, feet scrabbling for grip on polished rock. Up and up and down. Repeat. Learning the holds. Finding new ways. Rays of light stream onto the South Deeside Hills. A haze fills the valley and the distant mountains are grey in the gathering dusk. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Race up the boggy path to stand at the summit. Wind. Air. Sunlight. No sound but the wind and the laughter of children as they climb the tower. The lights of the village below twinkling as twilight gathers. A bite to eat and a slug of water and then off down, following the tracks of the mountain bikes. Slippery roots and beds of pine needles. Back in the shade of the forest there are more toadstools. There are no people. The gloaming creeps through the forest. Tree follows tree follows tree into a defocused nothingness. Then there is a turn. A way marker. A last steep descent. Back to the car. Lights on. The sky erupts in a final spectacular light show, welcoming in the return to Greenwich Mean Time. Back to the city. A cuppa. Rest.&lt;/p&gt;

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night at the &lt;a href="http://www.nemt.org.uk/"&gt;North East Mountain Trust's&lt;/a&gt; first winter talk of the season, &lt;a href="http://www.glasgowwestend.co.uk/people/Ianmitch.html"&gt;Ian R.

&lt;p&gt;Ian Mitchell is best known for his 1987 book &lt;em&gt;Mountain Days and Bothy Nights&lt;/em&gt; which he co-authored with David Brown. In his latest work, which he hopes to be the definitive biography of Kellas, he collaborated with &lt;a href="http://faculty.utah.edu/u0628487-George_Rodway,_PhD,_APRN/biography/index.hml"&gt;George Rodway&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Utah to piece together from the few written sources the story of this mysterious figure. Unlike his peers, and many of those characters which figure in the great stories of mountaineering history, Kellas really doesn't fit the profile of a typical world-class mountaineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellas was born and raised in Aberdeen, firstly on Regent’s Quay and later in a house on Carden Place. His mother’s family had a farmhouse near Ballater and it was from here that he and a brother had their first mountain adventure. From Ballater they walked 35 miles in to Loch Avon where they spent a dark, cold night under the Shelter Stone. The next day they summited Macdui and walked back to Ballater for a round trip of more than 70 miles. Kellas is also thought to have been one of the first people to rock climb in the Cairngorms, climbing to the summit of Cairn Toul by way of the mountain’s rocky north-east face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After further time spent in the Scottish Mountains, Kellas took a trip to Switzerland where a guide took him up the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finsteraarhorn"&gt;Finsteraarhorn&lt;/a&gt; in the Bernese Alps. In 1907 he went on his first trip to the Himalaya, exploring the mountains in the remote Indian state of Sikkim. By this time he was a highly regarded chemist, who had worked with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ramsay"&gt;William Ramsay&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery of the Noble Gases, and had taught at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During several visits to the Himalaya he made detailed studies of the approach routes and possible climbing routes of Kanchenjunga, the world’s third highest mountain, and attempted to summit many of the lower peaks in the state of Sikkim as well as exploring remote areas of Kashmir and Nepal. In 1911 he had a hugely successful year, summiting several mountains over 20,000 feet including one, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauhunri"&gt;Pauhunri&lt;/a&gt;, which was later (&lt;a href="http://outdoors.caledonianmercury.com/2010/11/17/scottish-climber-revealed-to-be-altitude-record-breaker-80-years-on/001314"&gt;after his death, sadly&lt;/a&gt;) found to be taller than its original surveyed height. This discovery retrospectively gave Kellas the height record from 1911 to 1930.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1921 he joined the first British expedition to explore the northern approach to Mount Everest and look for the possibilities of a route up the mountain itself. Sadly, just a day before he would have had his first close-up view of the great mountain he died, succumbing to complications arising from diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his numerous Himalayan achievements he was a celebrated name in mountain circles up until the Second World War, but for reasons unknown disappeared from the pages of history after that period. His name is now more recognised within high altitude physiology circles, an area which interested him greatly, and which was the area where his few public writings were published. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell hopes that with the publication of this book, the name of Kellas will once again garner the recognition it deserves… whether or not Aberdeen City Council feel it is a fitting tribute to erect a blue plaque on his first home on Regent’s Quay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitchell's lively talk brought this intriguing character to life, despite the rather sparse evidence (Kellas very rarely wrote up his mountaineering exploits), and it was a great chance to see some amazing images from the very beginning of Himalayan exploration and climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book, &lt;em&gt;Prelude to Everest: The Scottish Mountaineer Alexander Kellas Who Made Everest Possible&lt;/em&gt; by Ian R. Mitchell and George Rodway, is now available to buy and can be found at the usual popular online retailers if your local bookshop doesn't have a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a short account of Rodway's attempt to summit Kellas Peak, done as part of the research for the book, in this &lt;a href="http://www.himalayanclub.org/pdfs/elv18.html"&gt;report from the Himalayan Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="himalaya"></category><category term="illustrated talk"></category><category term="nemt"></category></entry><entry><title>Loch Avon Overnighter - The Gear</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter-the-gear/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-25T11:17:41+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-25T11:17:41+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-06-25:/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter-the-gear/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not a lot changed between this &lt;a href="/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter/"&gt;trip into the Cairngorms&lt;/a&gt;, and the two overnight trips I did in April. The night-time temperature, once the rain and clouds cleared, fell well below freezing so I was glad I took both my Icebreaker Merino baselayer and my PHD Down Vest, both of which were worn towards the end of the night. I was also pleased that my &lt;a href="http://www.seatosummit.com.au/showdetail.php?Code=AUDS"&gt;13l Sea 2 Summit Ultra-Sil drybag&lt;/a&gt; kept all my down and camp gear dry during the walk in on the rainy and snowy Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all my baseweight came in at 6,694g (14.8lbs) with only minor kit being dropped this time to give a similar weight to the last couple of trips. With about 1.5kg of consumables (food, fuel and water) plus my standard summer walking clothes and Terroc shoes, I had a skin-out weight of 10,239g, which is easily my lowest total weight for a camping trip so far. You can view my full kit list (in PDF format, 120kB) at &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B19qDwvSzsMCajNXZ2M3aUtFcU0"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scarp 1 tent proved again to be a great shelter, easy to pitch and keeping me sheltered from the snow and rain on Saturday evening. I did have some fun getting the pegs into the tough ground of the Cairngorm plateau, but a little gentle persuasion from a found rock helped them in. Once the rain had passed I had both the outer and inner folded back to enjoy the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5843112147/"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from the bedroom" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/5843112147_f01fb0dc1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still waiting to get a pair of lighter, thinner gloves for use outside of winter. Unfortunately my fleece gloves were left outside a dry bag so were quite wet by the time I got to camp. Lesson learned and I fully intend to pick up a rubbish compactor bag for use as a cheap pack liner to keep things beyond my down stuff dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wore an old pair of waterproof over trousers on Friday which appear to have developed a bit of a leak around the back of the knee. I think I will need to replace these with something lightweight, either the &lt;a href="http://www.golite.com/Product/ProdDetail.aspx?p=108001110&amp;amp;mc=169&amp;amp;t=&amp;amp;lat="&gt;Golite Tumalo Storm&lt;/a&gt; or something from the Paclite range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cooking was again nice and straightforward thanks to the ease of the Optimus Crux stove. I had a Fuizion Freeze Dried Food Chilli Con Carne meal on Saturday evening which was delicious. The Expedition Foods Porridge and Sultana was a good breakfast although I probably ate more food than I really needed for just a quick overnighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few nice chats with folk walking in towards MacDui whilst I was heading back to the car. Most were surprised to hear I had been camping given the size of my sack, and my lack of poles (I completely forgot these but didn't really miss them over the easy 28km route). I passed on some tent recommendations to a guy who was in the market for a light one-man tent to start some wild camping.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gear"></category><category term="optimus"></category><category term="scarp1"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>Backing the Backcountry Boiler</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/06/backing-the-backcountry-boiler/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-08T18:43:52+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-08T18:43:52+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-06-08:/blog/2011/06/backing-the-backcountry-boiler/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few months ago it was interesting to hear from the people who had taken a chance on the first batch of &lt;a href="http://www.theboilerwerks.com/"&gt;Backcountry Boilers&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The Backcountry Boiler had arrived and was an instant hit. Designed by Devin Montgomery over in the USA, the Boiler is a small solid fuel water boiler or kettle, purpose designed for lightweight backpacking. Some of the best of those initial posts were made by &lt;a href="http://the-radtkes.blogspot.com/2011/03/long-wait-is-over-backcountry-boiler.html"&gt;Brian Radtke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://heberhiking.blogspot.com/2011/03/backcountry-boiler.html"&gt;Heber Farnsworth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://lightweightoutdoors.com/?p=2088"&gt;Phil Turner&lt;/a&gt;. It was exciting to read Devin’s updates covering the &lt;a href="http://www.theboilerwerks.com/2011/03/people-and-dogs-seem-to-like-it/"&gt;whereabouts and adventures&lt;/a&gt; of several of the 100 (individually numbered) first generation boilers. In addition, Hendrik Morkel hosted a great &lt;a href="http://www.hikinginfinland.com/2011/02/backcountry-boiler-power-of-myog-and.html"&gt;interview with Devin&lt;/a&gt; over on his Hiking in Finland blog which explained a lot of the backstory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Devin &lt;a href="http://www.theboilerwerks.com/2011/05/kickstarter/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that he was going to be using &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/"&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; to fund the next batch of (improved) Boilers and again the word was quickly spread by blogs, Twitter and the forums on Backpackinglight.com. I was interested to hear the news and after a day or so of deliberation decided to give it a go, putting my name down for one of the 100 limited edition &lt;em&gt;Boiler Primes&lt;/em&gt;. These feature a hard anodised finish for added durability and a combined stuffsack and heatproof sleeve made of a softshell material. The take up for the Boiler was pretty incredible with the original target fund of $20,000 soon met and exceeded. Following this achievement Devin made a few changes to the lineup to cater for the interest and there is now another option if you are looking for something more than just the excellent standard Boiler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just a couple of days time the window of opportunity will close and there will be another while to wait if you are after your own Backcountry Boiler. Supporting this kind of small, independent, innovative manufacturer is a key part of my increased enjoyment in being a member of the online outdoor community and I think if you can spare the initial outlay, the end product will more than reward you for investing now. I'm looking forward to trying out my Boiler in Scotland, especially with the added possibility of using an alcohol burner. This would negate the difficulties often encountered finding suitable solid fuel (dry wood, twigs etc) higher up in the Scottish mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining the 500+ backers of this project then take a look at the above video and then check out the &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1763800459/backcountry-boiler-hot-water-from-found-fuel"&gt;Boiler's Kickstarter page&lt;/a&gt; which contains all the information you need.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vpmaps.com/anquet-maps/features"&gt;Anquet for Mac&lt;/a&gt; was launched back in July 2010, joining &lt;a href="http://www.routebuddy.com/"&gt;Routebuddy&lt;/a&gt; as the second native mapping application for the Mac. I've been using it now for around eight months, for both plotting routes and printing maps for use on my trips, and have been generally pleased with the software.

&lt;p&gt;The Anquet for Mac desktop software is free to download (from &lt;a href="http://www.vpmaps.com/"&gt;VP Maps&lt;/a&gt;) and the user then pays for maps. The software initially comes with some sample maps which are helpful to get a feel for using the programme and the routing tools before investing in more maps. Once going beyond the samples you must pay for mapping and Anquet offer a modest range of different digital maps from providers such as Harveys, Ordnance Survey, Philips and others. I imagine that most hikers, backpackers and outdoor folk are interested in the Ordnance Survey range and it seems that this is where the best deals are to be found. I took advantage of one such good discount offer (these are typically sent out via e-mail every 1-2 months by Anquet) and got all of northern Britain at 1:50,000 for less than £45. This gives me all the OS Landranger Maps for the entire area north of an east-west line drawn around Sheffield (below which be dragons anyway, right?) which easily covers my areas of interest (Scotland, and the Dales and Moors of Yorkshire). Typically their offers are very good with recent ones including a significantly discounted price for whole country maps, as well as extra vouchers to spend on 1:25,000 mapping etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Main screen showing a route on an OS map" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/anquet-1-main.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The download process isn’t perfect but your experience will probably depend on your internet connection. When I purchased the half country maps the downloads came as a number of smaller areas. This caused the downloads to queue up and for ones far down the list to eventually time out. I needed to manually restart them from the download manager which was fine once I realised the problem. However, overall this was a minor niggle and I have not encountered any problems/corruptions with downloaded maps, all of which are happily sitting on my computer for use whenever and wherever I happen to be (and one of the main advantages over online mapping applications such as those offered by Walk Highlands or Grough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Showing the Map buying screen with a Harvey area shown on the GB Road Map" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/anquet-2-maps.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rendering of the maps by the software is good with the standard zoom level easily readable and providing a wide area to plot routes upon (obviously this is dependent on your screen size and resolution) with it being possible to get rid of the sidebars to increase viewing area. You can zoom in to read small details and check contours with no degradation in sharpness of the rendered map. My four year old MacBook handles rendering well, only slowing down if you zoom right out at 1:50,000 and a large number of map tiles are required for display. This is an issue as it would be preferable to change automatically to a different map type (e.g. road atlas style map) as you zoom out, rather than rendering the same map at such extreme zooms. Switching between maps is a little clunky (the zoom level changes) but easy enough once you are used to the requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the software suffers from being quite un-Mac-like in that it isn't particularly intuitive to use. Features seem to be hidden away, and even doing the more straightforward things isn't always easy. Routing for example, can be quite arduous, particularly to begin with, as the commands are not always self-explanatory and the offered  tutorials and programme help lack detail. However, once you are used to routing and the database system (where your routes are stored) it is easy enough to plot out routes and then review the distance, elevation change and so on. One thing I miss here is that you only get the complete stats once you end the route, rather than seeing mileage appear and increase as you plot the route. However, a neat feature is that you can customise your walking and climbing pace to get a more accurate estimated time, rather than relying on something like Naismith's Rule. Furthermore Anquet for Mac fully supports the OS grid system so you can get detailed grid references for routes and camp sites etc as you plan, as well as jump to specific grid refs if you are taking information from the internet or guide books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A view showing an elevation profile for a route" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/anquet-3-profile.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people a key part of the user experience with mapping software is interfacing with your GPS device, whether it be Garmin, Satmap or some other type. Unfortunately, as far as I am aware, Anquet for Mac does not support any of these devices. This is a pain as it means you have to export your route(s) as a GPX file and then use something else to upload them to your GPS device. I have the basic Garmin RoadTrip software which came with my device which I use to manage routes and tracks but it is a shame that this extra piece of software is required to do a relatively simple task. In addition, it doesn't appear possible to display a track file, recorded on a device whilst outdoors, to compare it with your original route. Happily though Anquet for Mac does at least support importing GPX route files so, for example, routes available on &lt;a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/"&gt;Walk Highlands&lt;/a&gt; can be viewed and printed in using the software. Anquet for Mac also has its own database of routes which can easily be downloaded and viewed from dialogues within the software. I haven't explored this feature extensively yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, printing from Anquet for Mac is excellent. There are a number of different options to go through to make sure you use the minimal paper required and as long as you are zoomed out a little way you can preview the area of the map that you will be printing. I typically only print a route so I'm not sure how easy it is to print just an area of the map without a route. The route printout is good and you can customise colour and line weight as desired. The quality of the printed route, printed using a basic Epson inkjet printer, is very good and more than adequate for use in the field. I now very rarely take a full Landranger map out with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Feshie map printed out and in a waterproof case" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20505911/websites/tms/IMG_8281.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be keen to try out the new version of Routebuddy, particularly as the features described in Andy Howell's post do seem to address some of the shortcomings that I've encountered during my time spent using Anquet for Mac. It will also be interesting to see how their pricing structure works out, as it sounds like they may offer discounts to transition maps across when they have already been purchased for use with other software. This would be good as obviously, having made an investment in maps, I wouldn't be keen to start from scratch and have to buy maps over again in order to switch software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though, here are my summary thoughts on Anquet for Mac, having used it as my primary mapping tool for almost the past year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good quality map viewing and printing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customise walking and climbing pace to get accurate route timing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import and export GPX route files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map download manager works to give full uncorrupted maps despite some timeouts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Route plotting works well once you get used to the quirks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clunky interface that takes some getting used to, particularly using the routing tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maps don't change automatically as you zoom in and out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No direct support of GPS devices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No support for track files&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database system requires some management to avoid cluttering up maps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No preview of the route mileage and ascent as you are plotting a route&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Martin is always worth following for his interesting routes and lightweight kit set-up. He has blogged about his preparations including &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/05/tgo-challenge-kit-list.html"&gt;kit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/05/tgo-challenge-maps.html"&gt;maps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/01/challenge-planning.html"&gt;route planning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Martin had a very wet crossing and has written up an excellent account of his Challenge experience in a two part blog post &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2011/06/tgo-challenge-2011-part-one-of-two.html"&gt;starting here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He is intending to broadcast updates via Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Howell&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Andrew_Howell"&gt;Andrew Howell on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;) is taking part in the Challenge but not live updating as far as I can tell. However, he has engaged a number of excellent outdoor bloggers to write guest posts. The first one, from Colin Ibbotson is &lt;a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/trek-blog/2011/05/12/live-life-colin-ibbotson/"&gt;already up&lt;/a&gt; on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy has put a lot of effort into writing up his adventurous 2011 crossing, along with a lot of useful route information, which you can read in full &lt;a href="http://www.andyhowell.info/GOC-2011/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, someone who I didn't profile at the time, but whom I have subsequently "met" via his blog, Google+ and online, is Alan Sloman who has also done an excellent write up of his crossing. It begins at the beginning with Part 0 &lt;a href="http://alansloman.blogspot.com/2011/05/tgo-challenge-2011-journey-up.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Challenge is something I aspire to complete one day, though I don't think I'm ready to commit to a year just yet. I certainly need to build up more experience with wild camping and long through routes. Nevertheless, following the progress of this year’s Challengers, particularly with all the different technologies now available, is a great way of motivating myself to bring the date closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep track of them then you might want to check out this &lt;a href="http://www.adventuretradingpost.co.uk/maps/tgoc2011.aspx"&gt;SPOT tracking page&lt;/a&gt; as highlighted by the TGO Challenge organisers themselves. This one is provided by Adventure Trading Post who operate the SPOT satellite tracking technology now in use around the world. There are currently nine Challengers appearing on the map which updates every two minutes to show progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second option is to check out the individual &lt;a href="http://new.socialhiking.org.uk/"&gt;Social Hiking&lt;/a&gt; maps of the Challengers (see my links above). Social Hiking is a brilliant service that combines location information derived from a multitude of possible sources (Viewranger, Instamappr, Twitter, SPOT) and combines these with geotagged/timestamped media (from the likes of Flickr and Audioboo) to create fully interactive, media-rich maps of progress made. It is a great way to track and interact with people out and about. The intention of Social Hiking is to have a dedicated TGO Challenge Map launched this weekend which will cover all of the current Challengers using the service on one map - I'll update this post once a link is available..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’ve set up a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/list/Astronick/tgoc2011"&gt;Twitter list for the TGO Challenge 2011 competitors&lt;/a&gt; which you can follow to have all their updates in one place. I’ve added all those I know are taking part in the 2011 Challenge but please let me know in the comments if there are others (or if there is already a list like this in existence!) In addition, there are a couple of hashtags being used by a few folk to discuss the challenge, these are &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tgoc"&gt;#TGOC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23tgo"&gt;#TGO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social hiking"></category><category term="tgoc"></category></entry><entry><title>Carn an Righ Wild Camp - The Gear</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-the-gear/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-24T00:38:30+01:00</published><updated>2011-04-24T00:38:30+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-04-24:/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-the-gear/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So the gear is tidied up and packed away for now, the report has been written (see &lt;a href="/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-part-1/"&gt;Part 1 here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-part-1/"&gt;Part 2 here&lt;/a&gt;) and (sadly) the suntan is now fading as eastern Scotland is shrouded in mist and cloud.

&lt;h2&gt;Carried Weight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I updated my spreadsheet on getting back from the trip to check my final total weights (I made a few adjustments before loading the car). Without my waterproofs I set off from the car with a base weight of &lt;strong&gt;6.5kg&lt;/strong&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;2kg&lt;/strong&gt; of food, water and fuel. I was wearing &lt;strong&gt;2.7kg&lt;/strong&gt; of clothing (and using my trekking poles) so my total "skin out" weight came to &lt;strong&gt;11.2kg&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm very pleased with these statistics and overall didn't really notice the weight, particularly given that I carried my sack the whole way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view a PDF of my full gear list for the trip by clicking on &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B19qDwvSzsMCR0lMSVRCZGtROWc"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;. It should open in your web browser but you may need to save it to your computer prior to viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Osprey Talon 33 carried the weight brilliantly, keeping me comfy all weekend, particularly on Sunday where I was only wearing my thin base layer on top. I can't really fault the bag and although there are lighter alternatives around I'd have to be thoroughly convinced about their comfort before I would consider switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635403437"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fully loaded Osprey rucksack" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5635403437_4805095194_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shelter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a much better job this time of pitching the Terra Nova Laser Competition tent. Having studied a few of the videos available on Youtube I was able to get a much tighter pitch with the only visible 'sagging' at the windward end where the breeze was blowing the outer into the inner slightly. Overall the tent did a great job. It was noticeably warmer inside after sunset and although I still have problems with the restricted space at the tapered ends, it was fine once I got settled. Although I used my &lt;a href="http://www.alpkit.com/shop/cart.php?target=product&amp;amp;product_id=16259&amp;amp;category_id=287"&gt;Alpkit stakes&lt;/a&gt; I doubt that the original toothpick pegs supplied with the tent would have had any problem given the calm conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major problem, in contrast to the first trip with the tent last year, was a noticeable increase in condensation. The top of the inner was wet in the morning which gave me a very wet head. It had also caused moisture to fall on the footbox of the sleeping bag. As I got up with the rising sun it wasn't a serious problem and the inner dried off rapidly in the sunshine. The condensation was due to an almost complete lack of a breeze in the night, and therefore was a ventilation issue. I don't see how it would be possible to avoid this problem in the future if conditions are similar and suspect this is true of all tents given the very low winds I experienced. Next time I'll need to remember to pack my travel towel as my fleece hat was only partially effective at wiping down the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5640917553"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sock Drying Weather" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5010/5640917553_dac8c9bf75.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleep System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://pacoutdoor.com/sleeping-pads/view/peak-elite-ac"&gt;POE Peak Elite AC mat&lt;/a&gt; performed very well giving comfort and warmth throughout the night. Its small pack-size and low weight is impressive and I found it was supportive for both back and side sleeping thanks to the lengthways ridges. My &lt;a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=118"&gt;PHD Minim 400 sleeping bag&lt;/a&gt; was toasty and warm throughout the night and didn't seem to be affected by condensation touching it in the footbox area. The simple design of the bag probably means the hood area is less well baffled than other bags but I just drew the whole thing tightly around me and snuggled down inside the hood. My slim build does lead to some areas around the waist area where the bag isn't quite snug enough but this didn't affect me too much - it just means it is important to keep the top drawn closed to prevent losing warm air and so drawing in cooler night air. I also found the &lt;a href="http://www.rockrun.com/products/Exped-Air-Pillow.html"&gt;Exped Air Pillow&lt;/a&gt; to be very comfortable and having it under my head meant that the mat went all the way down to my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5647029214"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pacific Outdoor Equipment Stuffsack Detail" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5647029214_0afe91ba3a.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clothing and Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated having the &lt;a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/product_info.php?cat=111&amp;amp;products_id=112"&gt;PHD Minimus Vest&lt;/a&gt; around camp in the evening and during the night. It is hardly any weight but is wonderfully warm and very soft. The Small is a snug fit on me and does ride up a little around the waist but is overall excellent. I didn't need to wear the &lt;a href="http://rab.uk.com/products/mens-clothing/soft-shell/vapour-rise-jacket_1.html"&gt;Rab Vapour Rise jacket&lt;/a&gt; at all on Sunday but its warmth and wind protection was very welcome through Saturday when there was less sunshine and more wind about, particularly early on. The jacket packs down very effectively so adding it to the pack on Sunday wasn't an issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing several areas of boggy ground gave me damp socks which were compounded by exploring the area above my tent (a huge mess of bog). This gave me wringing wet socks and shoes which never fully dried out again. This is probably more a result of my leaking trail shoes which are definitely in need of replacement but I may need to consider different socks to replace my rough and ready Bridgedales (now 3 years old). Having a dry pair of socks for in the tent was great although I only wore them initially as the footbox of my bag soon heated up nicely. I definitely need to consider some Smartwool/Merino/Merino-Possum socks going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Icebreaker 200 long-sleeved base layer top worked out great - I wore it the entire time and it kept me warm at night but reasonably cool during the day. I also like having the SPF protection on the arms as this limits how much sun block I had to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cooking and Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finally obtained a windshield, the &lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-outdoor-kocher/optimus-crux/"&gt;Optimus Crux stove&lt;/a&gt; showed a marked increase in performance, boiling 0.5l of water (in my &lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-kochgeschirr-und-besteck/optimus-terra-solo/"&gt;Optimus Terra Solo Pot&lt;/a&gt;) in just under 4 minutes on a fairly moderate flow setting (I've roughly guessed the time). During the first boil it did go out after a couple of minutes for no apparent reason. Something must have moved in the mechanism or within the seating because there was no gas flow however far the valve was turned. I let everything cool down, disconnected it from the canister, folded it away and reopened it a couple of times before reattaching it to the fuel. After this I had no more problems and I had it lit on three further occasions for various food and drinks. After checking out a Youtube video I am now much more proficient with the Swedish Firesteel and got the stove lit really quickly every time I used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636045514"&gt;&lt;img alt="Optimus Crux Stove and Titantium Pot" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5636045514_3bcacdcd9f.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I had a rehydrated Chicken Tikka with Rice meal from &lt;a href="http://www.expeditionfoods.com/"&gt;Expedition Foods&lt;/a&gt;. This was my first time using them and I think I used slightly too much water. The packet states 484ml and suggests filling to a certain line, but it is difficult to judge this as the food already covers the line. Still, despite being a little watery, the taste and texture was very pleasant and it felt like a reasonably substantial meal. I finished off dinner with a Kenco Latte and a bar of Dairy Milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the morning I had an Expedition Foods Porridge with Sultanas and this time managed to use slightly too little water (I found a few dehydrated bits and pieces at the very bottom). However, the taste and consistency was excellent overall and coupled with another Latte (I boiled the water for both at the same time) made for a great start to the day. I would definitely recommend this although a few people just make up their own porridge mix which may be an equally effective a cheaper way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got a couple more Expedition Food packets to try but am going to order up some &lt;a href="https://www.fuizionfreezedriedfood.com/"&gt;Fuizion Meals&lt;/a&gt; for forthcoming trips as they seem to get excellent write-ups across the blogs and forums. I'm also considering moving to a meths stove as I still don't like the waste and extra weight involved in the canister stove, despite the upsides being ease and cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a little over 1.3kg and 5,000kcal of food but didn't eat all of this. I found that oatcakes, cheese slices and chorizo made excellent lunches on both days and was pleased with the variety of chocolate bars and cereal bars I took. I have run out of &lt;a href="http://www.nuun.com/"&gt;Nuun tablets&lt;/a&gt; and really noticed how much better they keep me hydrated than water - I usually only take 1l of Nuun and this can keep me going on a long day, but over the course of the two days on this trip I drank closer to 4.5l of water (excluding coffee and water in meals) and still didn't always feel hydrated. I'll order up some more tablets ASAP as they really are brilliant for effective hydration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I Need Next Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely was lucky with the weather and there was no need for any waterproofs - these would have added 0.5kg to my base weight if needed. I definitely need to find a thin pair of gloves for doing things in camp and generally keeping my fingers warm when not active - during the course of the evening my fingers got cold and I was finding it more and more difficult to tear open packets and fiddle with the stove. I also need a warmer, thinner pair of socks for camp - Merino-Possum for a real touch of luxury - as well as a thinner, supportive pair for use with my trail shoes during the summer months (i.e. hot days like Sunday). Otherwise the only major addition/change I see at the moment is perhaps trying out a meths/solid fuel stove, such as the Caldera Cone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="WWAWD"></category><category term="gear"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>'Book Review: The Wild Places by Robert Macfarlane'</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/02/book-review-the-wild-places-by-robert-macfarlane/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-08T22:03:48+00:00</published><updated>2011-02-08T22:03:48+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-02-08:/blog/2011/02/book-review-the-wild-places-by-robert-macfarlane/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20110208_202557.jpg" src="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/IMG_20110208_202557.jpg"&gt;Robert Macfarlane's extraordinary third book (his debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Mountains of the Mind&lt;/em&gt;, was praised on its release and won several high profile awards) is part travelogue, part history and part philosophical treatise.

</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_20110208_202557.jpg" src="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/wp-content/IMG_20110208_202557.jpg"&gt;Robert Macfarlane's extraordinary third book (his debut novel, &lt;em&gt;Mountains of the Mind&lt;/em&gt;, was praised on its release and won several high profile awards) is part travelogue, part history and part philosophical treatise. It weaves together an exploration of wild places in Britain and Ireland with the stories of those characters, past and present, that have helped shape and define &lt;em&gt;wildness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The narrative (and the term is used loosely here) is an attempt to piece together an alternative map of the British archipelago. Not one that is bound by the usual atlas-lines of roads, railways and other human marks, but one that follows something almost more tangible: the rivers, mountains, rock and movement of animals. It sweeps down from the far north-west of Scotland, through the west coast of Ireland and eventually through the central part of England until it ends in an unlikely place; a quiet corner of Essex. Though all of his journeys put him at the edge, Macfarlane brings out the central stories of people that have shaped the landscape, making way for the wildness that has ultimately grown in these forgotten corners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macfarlane's language and art of description has the power of a particularly striking landscape photograph, portraying the scene in exquisite detail, but also adding in the stories and histories wrapped up in a particular scene. Throughout the course of the book he re-visits, over and over, his initial hypothesis of what constitutes wildness, and comes to an unexpected conclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just a celebration of the beauty and power of wild places, there is also emotive descriptions of the challenge that wildness offers to a human. In particular, one dark and claustrophobic episode on the top of Ben Hope in the icy grip of winter reminds us that our understanding and ability to control wildness is tenuous and fleeting at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fascinating book, brilliantly crafted, which I think will connect with many people's experience of the wild corners of these small islands. Although the scenes in Scotland were initially of most interest to me, I found that the episodes in Wales, Ireland and England expanded my appreciation for wild land and how it can be appreciated, both at a very close and personal level, and in a wider social and historical context.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book review"></category></entry><entry><title>Three Years of Scottish Hillwalking</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/11/three-years-of-scottish-hillwalking/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-03T18:24:14+00:00</published><updated>2010-11-03T18:24:14+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-11-03:/blog/2010/11/three-years-of-scottish-hillwalking/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Three years ago on this day I jumped off the service bus into the cold, clear air of a bright November morning in Dinnet, a quiet village in the heart of Royal Deeside.

&lt;p&gt;Since then I've climbed ninety-nine other Munros (some more than once) and seen a great deal more of Scotland. Whilst the west coast is inarguably more dramatic and the mountains more shapely and challenging, I still have a great love for the eastern hills, particularly those south of the Dee where I first found my hiking feet. Over the winter I hope to revisit a few of my favourite areas, and hopefully climb some new hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks I'll probably post some thoughts on my favourite trips and mountains. In the meantime here is a slightly strange slideshow - an image of each of the Munro summits I've reached. For the ones where it was too misty/rainy/snowy to bother with a summit shot I've tried to add a representative photo of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Andy Nisbit - Climbing In The North West Highlands</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/10/andy-nisbit-climbing-in-the-north-west-highlands/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-14T23:27:10+01:00</published><updated>2010-10-14T23:27:10+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-10-14:/blog/2010/10/andy-nisbit-climbing-in-the-north-west-highlands/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first talk of the &lt;a href="http://www.nemt.org.uk/"&gt;North East Mountain Trust's&lt;/a&gt; (NEMT) &lt;a href="http://www.nemt.org.uk/talks/2010_11/index.html"&gt;winter series&lt;/a&gt; was an almost two hour wander through some of the most iconic mountains and cliffs in the North West Highlands.

Our guide for the evening was Andy Nisbit, who is currently the new route's editor at the Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC), as well as being the author and editor for several well known climbing guidebooks. In addition, anyone with a copy of &lt;em&gt;The Munros&lt;/em&gt; (the SMC's Hillwakers' Guide) could flick through the book and find several of Andy's fabulous photos illustrating various mountains. A noteworthy one, that I believe was shown last night at the talk, is to be found on page 218 of the revised and reprinted 3rd edition, which shows the famous Triple Buttress of Coire Mhic Fhearchair in the fastness of winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2836338752/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Mhic Fearchair" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3172/2836338752_7f4b9be655_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy criss-crossed a vast area of the country, moving backwards and forwards throughout his long career to show various first ascents. In particularly he focussed on the Torridon Hills, with new routes up frozen waterfalls on Liathach, and climbs in the aforementioned Coire Mhic Fhearchair on Beinn Eighe. A particularly memorable series of shots were taken from a wild camping site he and a friend established whilst exploring the coire's unclimbed cliffs during June. The photos were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;taken looking out over the lochan in the coire, towards the Flowerdale forest, with the wild and isolated hills silhouetted by a sun that was still only just setting at 11pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2844314660/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Almost at Am Fasarinen" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3202/2844314660_54d4f88b25_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy also showed some fabulous pictures of traversing Liathach, both in summer and in winter. In particular the winter photographs showed off the very alpine nature of the ridge and pinnacles. These were of particular interest to me as I completed the &lt;a href="/blog/2008/09/liathach/"&gt;full traverse of Liathach back in September 2008&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides Torridon, Andy also had photos from first ascents in Glen Shiel and Applecross as well as cliffs and waterfalls further north into Fisherfield and Assynt. Amongst these, and following &lt;a href="/blog/2010/02/beinn-liath-mhor/5"&gt;my climb of Beinn Liath Mhor back in February&lt;/a&gt;, it was great to see some photos of the mighty Corbett Fuar Tholl and its neighbouring Munro Sgorr Ruadh which both have interesting climbing on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His particular passion seems to be climbing frozen waterfalls. Whilst this is common on the continent, in Scotland the conditions are less favourable and some of the routes he has put up have yet to be repeated. He did however confidently predict that this winter will be the best for 20 years and that there should be a chance for a lot of second ascents!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4338027245/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The head of Coire Lair" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/4338027245_c10219cd96_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the talk Andy entertained the audience with stories of the characters that inhabited his photos, and some of the adventures that he had had. Sometimes it wasn't just about being on the rock and ice, but about the journey to get there. It was fascinating to see this quite different appreciation of the mountains and the passion that he has built up during a lifetime of living, working and exploring in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I Took&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main items of camping equipment I took with me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tiso.com/shop/osprey/talon_33/"&gt;Osprey Talon 33 rucksack&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.springfield-camping.co.uk/Terra+Nova/Laser+Competition+2009/591/pc"&gt;Terra Nova Laser Competition Tent&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=118"&gt;PHD Minim 400 Down Sleeping Bag&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/product442.asp?PageID=98"&gt;Ultralite Spider Compression Sack&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buachaille.com/p2254-3-29/Thermarests-&amp;amp;-Mats/Therm-a-Rest-ProLite-4-Regular.html"&gt;Thermarest Prolite 4 Regular Sleeping Mat&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-outdoor-kocher/optimus-crux/"&gt;Optimus Crux Stove&lt;/a&gt; with fuel, &lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-kochgeschirr-und-besteck/optimus-terra-solo/"&gt;Optimus Pot, Lid&lt;/a&gt; and Spork  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full kit list for the trip can be downloaded as a PDF by clicking &lt;a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Al9qDwvSzsMCdGkxbTJHNkRpNWdWSjRidDQ3ZkJjb2c&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;single=true&amp;amp;gid=1&amp;amp;output=pdf"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laser Competition did the job perfectly. Although I hadn't done a practice pitch for a long time the instructions sewn into the stuff sack were sufficiently detailed for me to get a reasonably descent set-up. I did short-cut a couple of steps which are shown in their pitching video but are not adequately described in the written instructions. Pitching is definitely something I need to work on though. Luckily the conditions were not at all testing on my trip - some light rain during the night and a very gentle breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel the breeze in the tent and so there was only minimal condensation on the inner of the fly in the morning. Next time I probably do need to attach the pole hood, just to be sure it wasn't rain that had got in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the size of the tent inner and porch to be perfect for me. The porch space easily swallowed all my kit and I had plenty of room in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleeping Bag and Mat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both worked well throughout the night. I used a Rab silk sleeping bag liner inside my PHD Minim 400 bag and felt a good temperature, perhaps slightly on the warm side throughout the night (and I'm fairly sure I sleep cold). It was definitely a cold night (probably mid-to-low single figures) as I progressively had to get more of my body inside the bag as the night went on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mat was good though it didn't completely protect me from a slightly rocky ground. Everyone last year was raving about the Neoair but I think I will persevere with the Prolite a little longer. If not, then this year's 'must have' mat seems to be the &lt;a href="http://jolly-green-giant.blogspot.com/2010/04/better-than-neoair.html"&gt;Ether Elite&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a travel pillow with my fleece stuffed inside - it was a little on the small side but I will supplement this with additional clothing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stove and cooking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only used the stove to heat up some water for a mug of hot chocolate before bed. Once lit it did this well, boiling 200ml of water in less than 5 minutes as I played around with the gas. I think Iâ€™ll need to pick up a wind shield as even the light breeze I had was sufficient to blow the flame around significantly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to light using a Light My Fire flint and striker which, although it sparked well, didnâ€™t seem to want to ignite the gas. Eventually it did, though Iâ€™m not sure what persuaded it. I will practice more with this at home before changing to a turbolighter or similar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Wild Camping"></category><category term="WWAWD"></category></entry><entry><title>New Gear - Wild Camping</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/06/new-gear-wild-camping/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-06-07T12:26:03+01:00</published><updated>2009-06-07T12:26:03+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-06-07:/blog/2009/06/new-gear-wild-camping/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This last month I've been focussing on putting together my wild camping kitlist.

Whether I'll get much done over the summer I don't know yet, but my main aim is to be sorted for some proper expeditions in early Autumn once the nights are a bit darker and the midgies have receded again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/images/Red%20d.png"&gt;Last month I took delivery of a &lt;a href="http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Product_Type/Tents/Superlite_Tents/Laser_Competition_RED.html"&gt;Terra Nova Laser Competition 2009&lt;/a&gt; model from Springfield Camping. After reading many, many Akto vs Lasercomp debates on the internet I went for the Lasercomp as I feel it more than meets my needs. My only slight concern is the length of the tent which is just about adequate. I do appreciate having the extra headroom though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been looking at the various modifications people have made to their tents but have decided to hold off doing anything major until I've had it out in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've pitched the tent a couple of times outside and it seems nice and straightforward. It also folds well into the stuffsack and in red, looks pretty mean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the tent came a &lt;a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/prolite/product"&gt;Thermarest ProLite 4&lt;/a&gt; self-inflating mat. Although the &lt;a href="http://cascadedesigns.com/Therm-A-Rest/Mattresses/Fast-And-Light/NeoAir/product"&gt;Neoair&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the way to go these days I've never, ever enjoyed that feeling of being on a lilo and so decided to take the extra volume of the Prolite for a better night's sleep. It seems to pack down pretty compactly as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/images/minim600_big.jpeg"&gt; My third important piece of kit arrived in the middle of a last week - a &lt;a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/product_info.php?cPath=26_60&amp;amp;products_id=118"&gt;PHD Minim 400&lt;/a&gt; down sleeping bag. This seems an amazing bit of kit, light and very packable whilst having a good temperature rating. I sleep just on the warm side so my thinking is that this will see me through a decent amount of the year and with a liner can be extended on a particularly cold spring/autumn night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/images/375b2090d4af9f0267a95817383aa3e6.jpeg"&gt;The fourth item was a camping stove. My aim is to only really use it for cups of tea and heating water for rehydrated meals so I went for something small and light - an &lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-outdoor-kocher/optimus-crux/"&gt;Optimus Crux&lt;/a&gt;. This is an amazingly small bit of kit but seems to do the job very well. The real test will be cooking outdoors on a sloping pitch with the wind howling all around. Luckily the Comp has a decent porch! To go with the Crux I also got a &lt;a href="http://www.optimusstoves.com/seen/optimus-products/products/katadynshopconnect/optimus-kochgeschirr-und-besteck/optimus-terra-solo/"&gt;solo titanium pot&lt;/a&gt; - the gas canister, stove and spork all fit inside of this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really looking forward to getting out and testing all this stuff for real and have a fair few plans up my sleeve for the next decent weather window.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="gear"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry></feed>
