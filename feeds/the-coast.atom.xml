&lt;p&gt;My birthday has slowly turned into the quest for the perfect barbeque. Previously we've wandered out to Glen Esk or somewhere on Deeside, but more often than not it has been in the kitchen at home, driven back by the usual July weather. This year we inexplicably threw caution to the wind, stepped up our ambitions tenfold and found ourselves putting together a plan for a weekend camping  on a beach in the far northwest of Scotland. Surely this would bring out the very worst in the weather. Can you even light a barbeque inside a closed tent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My birthday has slowly turned into the quest for the perfect barbeque. Previously we've wandered out to Glen Esk or somewhere on Deeside, but more often than not it has been in the kitchen at home, driven back by the usual July weather. This year we inexplicably threw caution to the wind, stepped up our ambitions tenfold and found ourselves putting together a plan for a weekend camping  on a beach in the far northwest of Scotland. Surely this would bring out the very worst in the weather. Can you even light a barbeque inside a closed tent?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can imagine our suprise then when not only was it not lashing down with rain, but that the third weekend in July was to be the apex of a glorious heatwave that brought sunshine and high twenties to Scotland. Stepping out of the car to stretch our legs besides Loch More on the long drive from Aberdeen to Kinlochbervie was like walking into the south of France. It was hot, and the reflections in the loch attested to the lack of wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route:  &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/392"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fh2iin" title="Ben Stack from Loch More by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Stack from Loch More" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5485/9370311995_9dc30b14fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so to Kinlochbervie, and the John Muir Trust car park at Oldshoremore where we shouldered packs and food supplies and set off down the well worn track towards the bay at the far end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gNoQdM" title="Loch na Gainimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch na Gainimh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/10370365013_dc4a65e1cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itâ€™s hard to forget that first view of Sandwood Bay, seen as the good track crests the hill and takes a final left turn where Sandwood Loch and its ruined lodge appear. Below them to the west is the bay; it's nothing more than a white halo of sand between the green hills and the blue sea. Northward the march of seacliffs recedes towards Cape Wrath and the hazy top of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhgBV1" title="First view of Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="First view of Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7327/9373106182_eb92f5f090_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down amongst the dunes the sand is soft and warm, the midday sun high overhead and the air filled with the smells of summer moorland mingling with salt and seaweed. With heavy packs we make our way along the beach, threading between the dunes to finally find our idyllic camping spot just above the outflow from the loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gNs3q8" title="Wild camping at Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camping at Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/10370991375_d84ccf5db5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic ocean overflows onto the sand. There is flotsam, a hatch cover from a boat half buried, by the water's edge. We dare the surf for a moment, our excited motions arrested by that first shock of cold as the sea surges and foams around our legs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gNtjb5" title="Surf at Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Surf at Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2890/10371239496_66b2795d3f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ocean stretches out into the unending west and the scale and the cold become too much. The languid river, warmed by the hot sun, is much better and we wade up its course, the water peat-stained but welcoming, tracing our fingers alongs ribbons of strata in the rusting cliffs along its bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN1UQg" title="Sparkling light at Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sparkling light at Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5524/10366088063_8983a0cb9c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gNxwwX" title="Water and Rock by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water and Rock" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/10372061523_b18243b3e8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun descends a little and the light changes again, becoming softer. We bite into barbequed corn on the cob drenched in butter and sip on beer pulled from the cooler. It's not exactly chilled, but delicious nonetheless. There are kebabs and burgers as smoke and the smell of sizzling meat drifts lazily through the long grasses growing on the dunes. There is not another person in sight. July birthdays don't get much more perfect than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN1xch" title="Smoking barbeques by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Smoking barbeques" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2878/10366015274_077b7d004e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the beach translucent domes - like colonies on an alien world - of  scattered jellyfish beached by the receding tide catch the sunlight like natural prisms. The surf breaks more gently now as the tide turns. A couple of figures are silhouetted on a distant outcropping of rock far down the bay, they are the only other people we have seen for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliffs provide a perfect playground and we scramble up and around them, exploring hidden coves and racing the incoming tide. The warm rock provides a perfect pair of sunloungers, the views out over Sandwood nothing short of spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN5Q6Q" title="Evening light over the ocean, Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Evening light over the ocean, Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/10366852594_3432fbd677_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sit side by side on the sandy dune below the tent watching as the sun lowers steadily into the haze on the western horizon, a red ball dropping towards the sea. The light is magical and as the pastel colours of sunset spread out across the bay we find ourselves taking one last walk around the dunes. Behind us a light mist lifts off Sandwood loch and spreads out across the wide strath. Above it the moon rises into a twilight sky, bright and full it shines out over the darkening shapes of the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN8oSX" title="Sandwood Bay sunset by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sandwood Bay sunset" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/10367353083_376e8b3b0c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July in the far north of Scotland guarantees a light night but in the half-dark an hour or so after sunset the unmistakable sight of night-shining clouds lights up the north-western sky. Roused from a light sleep I sit on the sand and watch ripples of electric light shimmering over the sea and cliffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN9bPX" title="Noctilucent clouds from Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Noctilucent clouds from Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2893/10367507653_af5bdfd36f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daybreak on Sunday comes early and it's already a bright morning when I crawl out of the tent to find another perfect unblemished blue sky has dawned over Sandwood. A trio of seabirds frogmarch down to the waterline as I parallel the wavelets, my footprints the only impression in the sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gN9LA6" title="Morning surf at Sandwood Bay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning surf at Sandwood Bay" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/10367621225_3a0eaf9e94_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first daytrippers arrive at the bay as we are lingering for a few final moments by the rockpools now exposed by the receding tide. There is laughter and movement and the Bay takes on a different character, no less wonderful than when we had it to ourselves, but different nonetheless. Although one of the more popular and well known locations in the far north, we had felt like the only ones there, castaways on a far-flung shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trip to the north west of the Scotland can only really end in one way. Fish and chips in Ullapool, sitting on the shingle watching the cruise ship out in Loch Broom. We sit, a little sunburned, and reflect back on a weekend stolen out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gNkcAC" title="Ardvreck and Quinag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ardvreck and Quinag" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/10369656476_d984ef4c41_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back now I genuinely have no idea how we'll top this - next year's birthday weekend is going to have to be very special indeed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the &lt;a href="http://www.jmt.org/"&gt;John Muir Trust&lt;/a&gt; is the leading conservation charity, caring for a number of incredible wild landscapes across Scotland, including Sandwood Bay. They are always looking for more support, particularly at a time when wild land is under more pressure than ever before. Please take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.jmt.org/"&gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; and consider &lt;a href="http://www.jmt.org/become-a-member.asp"&gt;becoming a member&lt;/a&gt; or making a one off donation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were dropped off close by the docks and soon set off past the Fisheries Museum with its large anchor and life-rings. At the end, rather than get wet feet, we took a left turn along a road of fish warehouses and car mechanics. This soon brought us out onto the first stretch of real coastline. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the grey houses of Lossiemouth behind us we passed the sombre tank trap before finally taking to the damp, sandy beach. The walking was easy going, keeping pace with the early morning leg-stretchers and breathing in the fresh sea air. With no climbing to be done people were happy to go at their own pace and soon groups formed, people chatting amiably amongst themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the lighthouse we stopped for elevenses. It stands prominently on a jumble of rocks littered with yet more coastal defences. Whilst some people made themselves comfortable, others went off to explore the sandstone cliffs and caves whilst down on the beach a Jack Vetriano re-staging was undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, though the skies were grey, it was mild and only the lightest of breezes was drifting in off the Moray Firth. We ambled onward, eventually reaching the end of the beach where the dayâ€™s major ascent began. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing up past fascinating examples of sedimentary and striated rocks, the trail led us up onto the top of the cliffs near Covesea. We followed the narrow track as it twisted and turned around the crinkly coastal contours. The track offers fantastic views and we paused often to gaze down into idyllic coves, admire amazing arched sea stacks and watch Fulmars wheel and dance above the rolling sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden there was a cry and everyone had stopped to see the distinctive fins of a pair of dolphins break through the waves. They were ambling along at much the same pace as us, also making towards Burghead. Sadly they were just a little bit too far away to get a photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6863170489"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4688.JPG" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7060/6863170489_75b099e4f2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the delights of the high cliff top path we left the coast slightly after pausing at the Coast Guard Station (mysteriously unmarked on the OS map). The broad path runs between high gorse bushes until you reach the large quarry at Clasach. Here the drizzle eased slightly so we paused for a bite of lunch. As the rain got heavier again we moved on, skirting the edge of the quarry, and soon encountered the famous (?)  dinosaur footprints. A series of rocks, uncovered during quarrying, have been dug up and are arranged in a semi-circle. The indentations were not overly impressive but the steady drizzle may well have dampened our paleontological interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on brought us back down to a series of small rocky bays separated by high dunes which were eerie and other-wordly in the mist. Eventually the ominous Hopeman Lodge loomed out of the swirling fog and we found ourselves walking alongside a long row of colourful beach huts, some with more extravagant designs than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Hopeman itself we again regrouped, observing another walking group who suddenly drove off in cars. We took to the road to make our way through the village as the signing around the caravan park wasnâ€™t very clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6863353075"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beachfront development" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6863353075_0d7647ca76_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we were on the final stretch which takes you along the route of a dismantled railway line. As such it is flat, easy going although sadly down in a cutting for most of the way so the views are limited. The last half mile or so however brings you back out onto the beach, this time just short of Burghead. The Malting Plant dominates the eastern side of the town and with mist and steam swirling around it the place looked like a post-apocalyptic film set. Endeavouring to get a good shot of the plant I had an entertaining encounter with some very slippery rocks but luckily managed to save my camera from damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reach the finish point we followed the coast around the outer street of Burghead until we reached the end of the spit of land that juts out into the Moray Firth. We climbed a short sharp hill up to the site of the &lt;em&gt;Clavie&lt;/em&gt; and the remains of a Pictish Fort and here we waited to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The local pub in Burghead was very welcoming (mainly because the lounge was empty and had plenty of seats) and we enjoyed a relaxed pint, sharing photos, swapping stories and generally looking back on what had been a pleasant day, despite the rain and drizzle during the second half.&lt;/p&gt;

This was a quite gentle walk, made more dramatic by the high seas and ferocious winds that were buffeting the clifftops and whipping up the spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1799162301/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Coastal Path" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2262/1799162301_3497d55ec4.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some quick shopping I started my walk at the harbour, walking along the south esplanade past some of the bigger docks where supply ships were being loaded ready for more trips out to the rigs. As the road climbed up to the lighthouse, I stuck to the shoreline and passed opposite the Marine Control tower and the various piers which were providing a nice perch for various cormorants and gulls. A small beach sheltered behind the southern breakwater which marked the end of the harbour and which the more energetic waves were managing to crest with a burst of white water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1801118004/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gratuitous Lighthouse Shot" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2315/1801118004_0ed7f53035.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then climbed up onto the clifftops and skirted round past the lighthouse where a sad reminder of the dangers of the seas was to be found. At the north end of Nigg Bay I passed the huge foghorn which warns ships of the entrance to the harbour and then came round, back on the road where it was almost impossible to walk in a straight line due to the strength of the wind. Down on the shoreline various cars were pulled up and the occupants watched as wave after wave crashed against the shorefront.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1801071410/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Exposure" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2257/1801071410_70e6f87040.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the bay I tried to walk over Tullos Hill but, after crossing the railway line via an arch bridge I was confronted with a maze of high security fences which seemed to force me back to north and out of my way. Whilst retracing my steps to regain the coast I saw a fox dart off down the path and shortly after a young deer, springing through the coarse grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the coast I picked up the Aberdeen coastal path as it continued south towards Cove. With the clouds growing ever darker and wind continuing to relent I left the path just past Doonie's Rare Breeds Farm and made me way through the Tullos Industrial Estate to get back home just as the sun was setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
