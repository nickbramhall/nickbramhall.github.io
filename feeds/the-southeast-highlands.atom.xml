&lt;p&gt;Back in March 2014 on a stormy weekend my friend Rich and I were defeated on an &lt;a href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2014/03/glen-lochay/"&gt;attempt to backpack around the Glen Lochay hills&lt;/a&gt;. After a tough slog up to the 900m point, white-out conditions on the final rocky ridge to the first Munro of Sgiath Chuil caused us to reconsider our options. We opted to retreat and descend from the bealach, seeking shelter in the glen. The strong wind never really dropped and after a very blustery night we walked back out to the car without having achieved our objectives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2015 I climbed &lt;a href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2015/05/creag-mhor/"&gt;Creag Mhor and Beinn Heasgarnich&lt;/a&gt; on the north side of Glen Lochay. &lt;a href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/04/a-hint-of-winter-on-ben-challuim/"&gt;Ben Challum had been combined with a neighbouring Corbett&lt;/a&gt; from Glen Dochart back in 2012. In terms of Munros this just left Sgiath Chuil and Meall Glas on the south side of the glen. Accessible from either Lochay or Glen Dochart to the south I chose the former approach based on it being the weekend and the thought that the road through Glen Dochart was probably likely to be busier in these strange post-Covid times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen Lochay was busy lower down with mild campers camped by their cars along the river. The parking area short of Kenknock was also busy at 10am but I managed to squeeze the car into a final space. The weather had been sunny through Stirling, Doune and Callander but had clouded over coming through Lochearnhead and Killin. The forecast was for a few showers but improving by lunchtime so I wasn’t too concerned...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500384028/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500384028_e19737c53e_b.jpg" alt="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trundled down the road to the farm at Kenknock and took a left turn at the crossroads before the large hydro pipe to follow the zig-zag hydro road up the hillside. There was a gate and a stile (with dog gate) to negotiate and I caught a glimpse of deer in the woods. The views down Glen Lochay opened up with the distant hills shrouded in showers. Below me at the farm hundreds of sheep were being herded and it was fascinating to watch the ebb and flow of them as the dog got them all sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501269047/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Shower over Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501269047_77fe396173_b.jpg" alt="Shower over Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the road another stile (also with dog gate) took me onto the open hillside. I followed the burn, a faint path coming and going before crossing the river and making for the higher, drier ground as directly as I could. At this point the showers visible in the west found me and turned into fifteen minutes or so of cold rain blown horizontally by a strong wind. It wasn’t particularly pleasant and at this point I was all for getting to the first summit and then returning home! It certainly didn't feel like mid-July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501142781/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Back to Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501142781_983599eb15_b.jpg" alt="Back to Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the rain petered out and in the wind and occasional sun I soon dried out again. The hills north of the glen were capped with cloud but conditions were improving on the hills closer to me which was encouraging. The ridge was straightforward, with just a couple of steep grassy sections. I have been running and cycling throughout lockdown and my hill fitness seemed pretty good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501306197/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501306197_12bab6efff_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I emerged at the summit of Meall a’ Churain, the 917m high Munro Top south of Sgiath Chuil, it was surprising how little time it had taken (about an hour from the top of the hydro pipe). Arriving here also coincided with a general improvement in the weather and it was quite sunny as I headed along the final broad ridge to the Munro summit, just 4m higher at 921m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501324127/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Summit of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501324127_ffda800279_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I neared the Munro summit I could look back to the northeast and see the rocky ridge that Rich and I had been climbing in the whiteout. I think it was the right choice to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501283331/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="The east ridge of Meall a&amp;#x27; Churain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501283331_2a261aa09b_b.jpg" alt="The east ridge of Meall a&amp;#x27; Churain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was very strong on the summit and after taking some photos at the cairn I found a sheltered spot to have a quick snack. A couple of folk were coming up the final slopes from the Glen Dochart side. For ten or so minutes it was a little brighter and there were patchy blue skies off to the east over Meall Geordaidh and the Lawers Range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501447912/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Summit of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501447912_c68c5deb3c_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501301141/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas from Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501301141_3658e0fa4f_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas from Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501489942/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="East from Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501489942_c7dabe273d_b.jpg" alt="East from Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising weather didn't hold and as I popped back up to the summit I could see more dark bands of showers blowing in from the west beyond Crianlarich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500632063/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Showers over Crianlarich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500632063_61bfd05104_b.jpg" alt="Showers over Crianlarich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent and re-ascent to reach the second Munro is notorious in bagging circles for both its steepness and total loss of height. From 921m you lose 300m down to the bealach below, all of which then has to be regained. I tried my best to find a reasonable way down, angling southwest on a loosely defined ridge. Just above some crags I picked up a quite well defined deer trod but sadly this led me to some very steep and unpleasant ground. Once down this though the slope started to ease and I made it to the bealach in one piece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501509022/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Descent of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501509022_c8e6ce8171_b.jpg" alt="Descent of Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500655618/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500655618_d2d22a29b7_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d studied the other side carefully as I descended and identified a promising route up to join the ridge to the north of Beinn Cheathaich, a Munro top at 937m high. By now another shower had passed through and blue sky once again appeared to the west. Now Sgiath Chuil had cloud curling around its summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501540362/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501540362_7dd9bde9e8_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501550922/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501550922_fdce62e42b_b.jpg" alt="Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slopes of Beinn Cheathaich are rough but presented no technical difficulties. Only the very final pull up to the ridgeline was steep but it was soon over and the views opened back out. I could see down to the farm at Kenknock in Glen Lochay with Meall Geordaidh climbing behind it. The hills of Mamlorn were now clear of the earlier cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501586057/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Towards Meall Geordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501586057_d3393e0f86_b.jpg" alt="Towards Meall Geordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500721978/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500721978_0e65da7edd_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather seemed much more cheerful at this point with the sun shining on me as I followed the broad ridge up to the summit of this Munro Top. It offers excellent views back across the low bealach to Sgiath Chuil and around a pleasing sweep of wide ridge to the Munro of Meall Glas. A couple of people could be seen but overall these hills seem fairly quiet and mostly overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500764873/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Summit of Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500764873_9886dbdb58_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501471106/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501471106_344bbd4817_b.jpg" alt="Sgiath Chuil"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the clouds now breaking and sunshine streaming down I was hopeful that this was the promised improvement in the weather. I now had excellent views of all the hills surrounding Glen Lochay, from Ben Challum in the west to Beinn Hearsgarnich to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500775323/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas and Beinn Challum"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500775323_85b616f0c9_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas and Beinn Challum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501642692/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Creag Mhor from Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501642692_61d256c25d_b.jpg" alt="Creag Mhor from Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route from here followed a grassy ridge over a spot height at 908m and then up to the Munro summit of Meall Glas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501496986/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas from Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501496986_974e607d2f_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas from Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I descended the grassy slopes and made my way up to the spot height. The path bypasses this flat summit but it wasn't much of a diversion to reach it and there were some good views to the Crianlarich hills which were emerging as the showers moved away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500796728/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Towards Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500796728_5a62149a0c_b.jpg" alt="Towards Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500845238/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500845238_40226c182d_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501724997/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="The Crianlarich hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501724997_ed8590ed95_b.jpg" alt="The Crianlarich hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this I rejoined the main path and headed up to Meal Glas. A couple passed me on their way back down and we briefly said hello. Unfortunately the weather closed in again and I found myself back in misty, rainy conditions as I made my way up to the Munro summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501544136/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501544136_2e7eac3565_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Cheathaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500862743/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500862743_be1463dbf7_b.jpg" alt="Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fairly dismal at the top, with the surrounding hills now hidden from view behind sweeping veils of cloud and rain. I stood at the top for a short time before hunkering down for a snack break. I spent a little bit of time pondering my route back to the car. The Corbett of Beinn nam Imrein was just to the west and didn't look too much further, and from the foot of its north ridge I would pick up a good track back down into Glen Lochay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501610386/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Summit of Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501610386_5c8c6c8ce5_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501617681/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Sgiath Chuil from Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501617681_d82e069cc3_b.jpg" alt="Sgiath Chuil from Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501590251/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Ben Challum"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501590251_3c6d001480_b.jpg" alt="Ben Challum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather didn't really improve and despite it being summer I was getting colder sitting around so I decided to make a move, leaving the summit and heading down the slopes of Meall Glas. Initially this took me back eastward to avoid some crags but once down the initial steepness I turned southwest and followed grassy slopes down towards the boggy looking land at the head of the Allt Glas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501782222/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn nan Imirean from Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501782222_2b6406da3b_b.jpg" alt="Beinn nan Imirean from Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way down it started to brighten up a little and I came across a delightful little tumbling waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500933923/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500933923_dc58ac8ef3_b.jpg" alt="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500972723/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Waterfall below Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500972723_b55d62609a_b.jpg" alt="Waterfall below Meall Glas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50500988778/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50500988778_e0259fc50b_b.jpg" alt="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground at the bottom proved less boggy than I feared and I was able to cut straight across to the broad southeastern ridge of Beinn nan Imirean. The initial climb was up grassy slopes which brought me to a shelf containing a wind blown lochan with views over to Ben More and its neighbours. The light was now improving to the west although there was definitely still a threat of showers. Behind me Meall Glas was revealed as a great dome of a hill, with the more elegantly shaped Sgiath Chuil beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now just a short way up to the summit of the Corbett. I arrived just as more showers were appearing over the Mamlorns. There was a good rock to shelter behind though and as it was still mid-afternoon I decided I could wait to see whether any better light blew in. This is a good location for views, with Ben Challum now very close in the west, and good views back over the other Glen Lochay hills I had traversed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More showers blew in so I hunkered down, enjoying the last of my snacks. When it cleared up again there was some good light over the hills to the south and east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skies almost started to look summery at this point with fluffy white clouds in a blue sky. They provided a nice backdrop to the hills of Mamlorn. Over on Meall Glas I watched the last pair of walkers leave the summit and head back down towards Glen Dochard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time was advancing I finally got my things together and headed off. The good weather stuck with me briefly as I started the descent, now following the easy angled north ridge leading me down towards Glen Lochay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50502336192/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Summit of Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50502336192_2f5a0eb9a9_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the slope reached a steep end I turned east into the side glen below Meall Glas. Heavy showers were once again sweeping over Mamlorn. I crossed over a small burn and then an area of tussock and bog to reach the top of the vehicle track marked on the OS 50k map. A huge herd of deer were grazing the slopes further east but didn't seem particularly perturbed by my presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501584143/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Towards Ben Lui"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501584143_10bd9e4636_b.jpg" alt="Towards Ben Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now a simple case of following the track down to the River Lochay itself. There were good views to some waterfalls as the burn came tumbling down just to the west of the track. As I dropped into the glen the sun came out once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501655718/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Descent into Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501655718_813b71dddd_b.jpg" alt="Descent into Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50501711238/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50501711238_acb1e41e95_b.jpg" alt="Beinn nan Imirean"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy to ford the river at this point and soon I was on the main track through Glen Lochay that would eventually lead me back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50502472406/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="The River Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50502472406_c069a0d1af_b.jpg" alt="The River Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the track through Glen Lochay is long, it is easy going and I started covering the distance quickly, especially as the conditions were good with the wind to my back. Ben Challum was picked out by the early evening sunshine and looked very dramatic as I got further down the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50502497336/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Mamlorn hills from Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50502497336_d34cb34556_b.jpg" alt="Mamlorn hills from Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I was going to get back in the dry when suddenly the sky behind me darkened and yet another shower swept down the glen. I paused to don waterproofs before continuing the walk. Thankfully it petered out fairly quickly and I was soon looking up the long ridge to Sgiath Chuil where the walk had started a few hours previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50502778272/in/album-72157716512991761/" title="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50502778272_ef1ddc07fd_b.jpg" alt="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was now winding my way between sheep fields and then reached the crossroads and the short stretch of tarmac back to the car. It was a little after 6pm and I was the last car left in the parking area. I didn't hang around though as, in the shelter of the trees near the river, the midges soon found me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driving out was fine until I got to within a couple of miles of Killin where it was suddenly absolute carnage with mild campers setting up all along the riverbank. There were even people pitching giant marquee/tents half on the road! I was glad to make it out and on to the main road, enjoying a pleasant drive home in brighter evening conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category><category term="munro-top"></category><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>Beinn Each and Stuc a' Chroin</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2020/07/beinn-each-and-stuc-a-chroin/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-06T08:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-07-06T08:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2020-07-06:/blog/2020/07/beinn-each-and-stuc-a-chroin/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beinn Each accessed from Loch Lubnaig with a detour up to the Munro of Stuc a' Chroin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 06 July 2020&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 14.0km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1238m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5hrs&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Beinn Each (Corbett), Stuc a' Chroin (Munro)&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny, strong cool wind all day&lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/515"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 23rd March the country went into lockdown due to the rapid spread of COVID19. In the fifteen or so weeks since then I have stuck to walks from my door. During the full lockdown this was limited to a daily dog walk through the local woods. As lockdown eased I started to venture into the lower Ochils immediately above my house and then further into the Ochils, exploring new routes and appreciating what I had available to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 3rd July the “five mile” limit on non-essential trips was finally lifted and so the Highlands beckoned. After sitting frustratedly through a great spring of beautiful weather the forecast for the first weekend in July was typically apocalyptic with rain and high winds the order of the day. However, I also had the Monday off and though the forecast was still iffy, the day itself dawned bright and clear with a cool breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick gear faff Cob and I headed off, leaving the county in the car for only the second time since late March (the other time was a quick essential errand to Stirling). The world felt reasonably normal through the hillfoots, Bridge of Allan and Doune. Callander was a ghost town. A few sets of roadworks slowed me down but soon we were alongside Loch Lubnaig and pulling into the large layby where the start of the Right of Way to Loch Earn via Glen Ample is clearly signed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107637722/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Footpath"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107637722_0eaa15dfe0_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Footpath"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first section is a delightful path that runs between the burn and a construction site at Ardchullerie More. Then it is up through a gloomy stretch of forestry which gradually turns greener and mossy as you climb before putting you out on a land rover track now high above the Ardchullerie Burn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50106831513/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Above Loch Lubnaig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50106831513_a5cac04254_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Above Loch Lubnaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107666622/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Footpath above Ardchullarie"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107666622_917442745d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Footpath above Ardchullarie"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this track north we were soon out of the trees and enjoying this narrow glen with views developing back to Loch Lubnaig and ahead to the lower slopes of Beinn Each. After a few days of rain the side burns were all chattering merrily but there were no problems with getting across any of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107458011/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="The track to Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107458011_af07e32502_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The track to Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrow footpath to Beinn Each itself is clearly signed from the top of the pass and after a quick break to watch a construction helicopter countering up the pass we headed up it, a delightful line through green bracken with the Eas an Eoin burn off to our right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107730882/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Construction Helicopter"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107730882_d9078c16a5_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Construction Helicopter"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107511891/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="The Beinn Each path"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107511891_1c75997bba_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Beinn Each path"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough the burn is left behind and a series of rising traverses gain the west side of Beinn Each’s southern ridge. The path rises and falls along the edge of the ridge for some distance before turning up and over a couple of intermediate summits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50106990703/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Ben Ledi above Loch Lubnaig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50106990703_e7a7c71693_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Ledi above Loch Lubnaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107858517/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="The path above Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107858517_8d7da53119_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The path above Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views across to Ben Ledi were developing nicely and in the distance I could see the Crianlarich hills stubbornly holding onto some morning cloud. The conditions on Beinn Each were good though with bright sunshine occasionally broken by a cloud moving through. There was fierce northwesterly wind which had me searching for my gloves buried somewhere in the rucksack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few more rising shoulders to get up and over but each of these brought increasingly impressive views, first down Glen Ample towards Lochearnhead and the Lawers range, and then to the pointed summit of Stuc a' Chroin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final climb is a little steep and scrabbly but we were rewarded with an empty summit and stunning views across to Stuc a’ Chroin and down the length of Glen Ample to the distant Lawers hills beyond Loch Earn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away to the southeast we could see down the length of Gleann a’ Chroin and away off to the Ochils and Stirling. We found a hollow tucked out of the wind and sat down for a rest and some snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108064361/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Glen a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108064361_732ba9ac69_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107513798/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Summit of Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107513798_b5c0e10e0c_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan from here was to descend down north to the Bealach nan Cabar and then, either continue up to Stuc a' Chroin via the lumpy interconnecting ridge, or drop down into Glen Ample. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107541803/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107541803_8ff965c5a6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107551283/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Glen Ample and Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107551283_b92502f806_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Ample and Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108167566/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Gleann a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108167566_f0203c4aa4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Gleann a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial descent north from Beinn Each is steep but on a clear path and after negotiating a couple of scrabbly steps I followed a series of zig zags down to the bealach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108421427/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Descent north from Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108421427_db2687ed60_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Descent north from Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108225986/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108225986_955e66feb3_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108229221/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108229221_dcf702c777_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land here is a series of rocky escarpments that are gentle on the south side but drop precipitously to the north. It was fun picking our way along these, occasionally saving to double back when we found ourselves at a steep drop. There is a path that we followed occasionally though this mostly seems to bypass the steps on their east side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108213826/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108213826_16e11dca23_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107668513/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Bealach nan Cabar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107668513_d72364f95c_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Bealach nan Cabar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the far end the ridge then turns east to wind its way up to Stuc a' Chroin. After briefly checking that the descent from here into Glen Ample looked feasible we turned east and headed uphill again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108492687/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108492687_cb5521ec2b_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108291846/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="The southwest ridge of Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108291846_3344e265ce_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The southwest ridge of Stuc a’ Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were excellent views as we climbed down Glen Ample to Lochearnhead and beyond it the dark shapes of the Lawers range. As the morning had progressed there cloud had lifted from the nearby Munros and everything was looking very summery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108334091/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Back to Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108334091_77d7334e4a_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Back to Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108628142/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108628142_8a559fed8d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path mostly follows a line of rusted fenceposts. We made life difficult for ourselves by dropping into a boggy hollow that led to a very craggy section. We had to turn north for a while where we picked up the main path again and we soon up to the final shoulder. From here it was just a short climb up to the summit plateau of Stuc a' Chroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108412591/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each and the Trossachs"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108412591_c139b587af_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each and the Trossachs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107862403/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Lochan a’ Chroin and Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107862403_bae20ea232_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Lochan a’ Chroin and Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the very quiet journey along the ridge it was something of a shock to find a half dozen groups of people on the Munro summit with more people heading up from Ben Vorlich. I took the opportunity in a lull to visit the summit cairn, enjoying the views across the glen to neighbouring Ben Vorlich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107877303/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107877303_3534dbfd08_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107926743/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107926743_c0a6361ef9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108506851/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108506851_9c68ce20ea_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we had an amble around the summit area until we found a quiet spot to sit down and have lunch looking out over Lochan a' Chroin and across to Beinn Each and Ben Ledi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50107962923/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each and the Trossachs"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50107962923_1f2f9cb7c6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each and the Trossachs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch it was back the way we had come, dropping down the slopes to the low point above Glen Ample. I passed a group of people coming up from Beinn Each but otherwise it was a return to solitude. I followed the clear path which stuck to the high point rather than dropping into the boggy bowl and this proved much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108542606/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Ben Vorlich from Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108542606_48eb54f97c_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich from Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108808847/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="West from Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108808847_26f8d52062_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="West from Stuc a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108861447/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108861447_12d9a5414f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point I had checked out early we left the ridge and dropped steeply down the grassy slopes into Glen Ample. Although I had to pick my way down carefully there were no major issues. The worst part was when one of my trail shoes decided to come apart at the seam which made for some interesting moments on the slippery grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108631761/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108631761_53c2a5d45d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108646056/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Lawers beyond Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108646056_42d2741b79_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Lawers beyond Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached the track in Glen Ample where it was warm and sunny. After a cooling splash in the burn we turned south and followed the track up to the watershed. Looking up to Beinn Each I was happy with my choice of descent as the slopes here were covered in bracken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108666291/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Track in Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108666291_79a46d65ef_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Track in Glen Ample"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up at the watershed we met back with our outward route, following the track back down to Ardchullerie. It was a delight to amble down here in the warm afternoon sunshine. The descent back to the road was straightforward and made for a very pleasant end to the walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50108714601/in/album-72157715080044238/" title="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50108714601_e55a94f0cb_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Each"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive home was remarkable only for the fact that in the afternoon Callander had come alive and looked very touristy, crowds of people around and folk sitting in beer gardens and enjoying takeaway from cafes along the high street.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Ben Vorlich in Arrochar</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2019/04/ben-vorlich-arrochar/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-13T22:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-04-13T22:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2019-04-13:/blog/2019/04/ben-vorlich-arrochar/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A straightforward ascent of Ben Vorlich in the Arrochar Alps from Inveruglas on Loch Lomond&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 13th April 2019&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 13.9km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,004m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5hrs 20mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Ben Vorlich (Munro, 943m)       &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very strong easterly wind, cloud on top with sunshine developing
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/465"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cool start to the day driving through Stirling and west to my Aunt and Uncle's house. The MWIS forecast was for a bright day with a very strong easterly wind. With plenty of hills to choose from in the Arrochar area we settled on Ben Vorlich as a good option with the majority of the climbing being done on the west side of the hill which would be sheltered from the worst of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a sunny drive to the large visitor centre at Inveruglas on the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond and were soon booted up and following the hydro road up towards the Sloy dam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33829007528/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Heading towards Loch Sloy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/33829007528_74584761ac_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Heading towards Loch Sloy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was hardly a cloud in the sky at this point of the day but what clouds there were, were moving fast on the promised easterly wind. Ben Vane stands guardian over the Sloy road and we made good progress around its foot to the cairned junction where a well-built footpath leaves to climb the slopes of Ben Vorlich. The upper slopes appeared to have had a dusting of snow or ice over night and they contrasted nicely with the blue skies and late spring tones of the hills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46790274935/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Vorlich from the Loch Sloy access road"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46790274935_d27c898418_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich from the Loch Sloy access road"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the junction we paused for a refreshment stop and a bite of home baking before tackling the steep lower section of the path. Here a lot of path building work has been done and stepped stones help you quickly gain height above the glen. We were soon pausing to catch our breaths and looking over the Sloy dam and the hills of Arrochar. A’Chrois to the southwest particularly catches the eye with its sharp-profiled summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47995988271/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="A&amp;#x27; Chrois from above the Sloy road"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47995988271_c47beba11e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="A&amp;#x27; Chrois from above the Sloy road"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47995980803/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Loch Sloy Dam"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47995980803_e7dd385e18_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Sloy Dam"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above the first steep section the angle eases off and the way becomes a bit boggier. We wound around outcrops as the path finds its way up towards the higher slopes of the hill. As we climbed the skies gradually filled in with cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996008392/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Loch Sloy Dam"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996008392_6c5b9d02f7_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Sloy Dam"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996052562/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="A&amp;#x27; Chrois and Ben Vane"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996052562_2e42040a12_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="A&amp;#x27; Chrois and Ben Vane"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path eventually takes a left turn and then climbs more steeply up towards a notch on the summit ridge. There are a few turns over steep escarpments and it makes for a more lively climb compared to the middle section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we could tell the wind whistling over the crags above us was fierce, and speaking to a couple of people who were already heading down confirmed that it was pretty wild on top, albeit manageable if you took care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views were opening up to the south and we could see Ben Narnain and the Lochgoil hills under steely skies. Loch Lomond was just peeking in around a corner of the hill, soon followed by Ben Lomond across the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996086453/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Loch Lomond"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996086453_4e6d0c63dc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Lomond"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996144897/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Loch Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996144897_52f58a4fd9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After climbing to the ridge we now followed the path as it wound its way around crags and gullies. On the west side there were views down to Loch Sloy and out across Arrochar. The grass here was white with rime ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996186248/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Vane and Loch Sloy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996186248_4f6e5b681a_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vane and Loch Sloy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996193142/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Narnain and Ben Vane"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996193142_f0fc99ff9e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Narnain and Ben Vane"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996218973/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996218973_6a6ec29808_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we came out onto the east side of the hill we found out how hard the wind was blowing. Below us the Little Hills stretched away towards Loch Lomond - in more favourable conditions these would likely have been a more interesting route of ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996230303/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="The Little Hills of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996230303_d3e96ee316_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Little Hills of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996262512/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996262512_1c7bdb55b0_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996270887/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="East from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996270887_1dc5145908_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="East from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to make progress here with the ground icy underfoot and the wind gusting enough to constantly be blowing you off course. Poles helped a bit though and we toiled out way towards the trig point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996276807/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996276807_87b1a86fd0_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996295353/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996295353_43b8ee0c15_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Lomond from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there is a short distance and a mild depression to get to the true summit. This was the hardest part and we were almost on hands and knees as we arrived at the summit. We sought shelter behind some rocks and made a short dash to touch the cairn marking the top of the Munro. There were good views but it was almost impossible to stand still. I huddled up against the cairn and took a few photos before retreating off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996318292/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Summit area of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996318292_7317b02527_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit area of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996329218/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="North from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996329218_2cf4fc3dbe_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="North from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996357612/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="The Trossachs from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996357612_d85807ea80_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Trossachs from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t hang around for long as the wind chill was incredible. For the return I dug my ski goggles out of my sack and this the made the going somewhat more pleasurable, especially with my hood cinched up tightly around them so as to minimise exposed skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996358938/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Summit area of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996358938_65f4d0d515_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit area of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996380212/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="The Trossachs from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996380212_14432fa192_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Trossachs from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996425841/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Arrochar Alps from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996425841_978d1f478f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Arrochar Alps from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made our way back across to the trig point. Surprisingly the mountain was getting busier and we paused to talk/sympathise with a couple of people who were heading for the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996420953/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996420953_87bd579de9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Vorlich summit ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996460968/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Windy on Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996460968_f903a1fefe_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Windy on Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed down, now enjoying the views down towards Loch Lomond which was lit up by patches of sunshine. There was a steady stream of people coming up but we were glad to be dropping down and out of the very worst of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47996518331/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Descent of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47996518331_99a56898d2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Descent of Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We swung back over to the east side of the ridge with the dramatic views down to Loch Sloy and the dam and over to Ben Vane and the other Arrochar peaks. This brought us back to the first section of the ridge just before the descent where it was somewhat more sheltered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47998655691/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Loch Arklet from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/47998655691_3439332ccb_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Arklet from Ben Vorlich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we paused to have a proper lunch, glad to be out of the worst of the wind. We tucked into a hearty hill lunch and by the time we were pulling our packs back on the day was improving and the sunny spells ever increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48008033793/in/album-72157706762439691/" title="Ben Lomond and Loch Lomond"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48008033793_b3bbe05bc9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Lomond and Loch Lomond"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way down felt much steeper in parts than it had coming up but we simply retraced our steps and were soon back down to the boggy area with views to the Sloy dam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dropped down the steps and rejoined the tarmac’d hydro road, following it back out to Loch Lomond. The early afternoon sunshine was bright and warm and we already felt a million miles way from the harsh winds up on the tops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove back to the house where we tucked into plenty of tea and cake before I travelled the rest of the way home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Meall Ghaordaidh</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2019/03/meall-ghaordaidh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-03-31T22:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-03-31T22:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2019-03-31:/blog/2019/03/meall-ghaordaidh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A circuit taking in the Corbett of Beinn nan Oighreag and the Munro of Meall Ghaordaidh above Glen Lochay near Killin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 31st March 2019&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 15.5km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,157m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5hrs 45mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Meall Ghaordaidh (Munro, 1,039m), Beinn nan Oighreag (Corbett, 909m)
Weather: Bright and sunny with barely any wind at all  &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/385"&gt;Click to view on an OS Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the clocks had changed the morning dawned with a crisp, frosty feel to the air more appropriate for winter than early spring. The dawn was also cloudless and as I drove over the hills towards Doune the peaks of the Trossachs glowed red in the morning sky. Glen Lochay was quiet and only one car had beaten me to the start of the walk up to Meall Ghaordaidh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this being a fairly straightforward Munro, I decided to extend the day by also taking in the neighbouring Corbett of Beinn nan Oighean. The start of the walk was the same for both, crossing a couple of sheep pastures to gain a vehicle track that wound up alongside the Allt a' Croisg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46602078495/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Dhuin Croisg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7890/46602078495_35b8b8dd7f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Dhuin Croisg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing a stone wall by way of a sturdy stile the landrover track continued up the hillside. As it wound off uphill I followed a narrower footpath that stayed closer to the edge of the water. Eventually though I rejoined the vehicle track higher up and followed this until it petered out up near the shielings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/32575167367/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="The Allt na h-Iolaire"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7899/32575167367_818e0dfd9d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Allt na h-Iolaire"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was a bit of a slog across boggy and tussocky ground to gain the lower slopes of Beinn nan Oighean. Off to the left Meall Ghaordaidh was picked out in snow-clad white with the ridge of Cam Chreag extending off to the right. Above me a huge phalanx of geese, easily more than 50, flew over me heading northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46793805864/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7875/46793805864_dc01145be2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On firmer ground I quickly gained height, watching as the western side of the Tarmachan Ridge emerged from behind the closer hillside. Higher up a more definite track appeared and I followed this up through some rocky outcroppings emerging on the rounded plateau with views up to the summit. With the steep climb done I enjoyed the bimble across the grassy plateau, enjoying the fact that there was barely any wind and that the views had opened out nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46602183855/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Across the Lairig Bhreislich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7854/46602183855_84b0471db8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Across the Lairig Bhreislich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47517621241/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7850/47517621241_162ab4c325_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46602196895/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7884/46602196895_27060c57e7_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once across the plateau there was a second steep but short pull up to the summit area. As I’d moved northward the views had changed and now Glen Lyon dominated the view, its loch a mirror below the encircling, snow-streaked peaks. I also caught a glimpse of the end of Loch an Daimh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46793898654/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7897/46793898654_4a114d44a4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47517718911/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7912/47517718911_e9e2c0fc50_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46602293125/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7886/46602293125_c6c4394ce0_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/40554634493/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7827/40554634493_6947177441_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit was a rocky slab with a small cairn on top of it. I paused here briefly but then continued on to the next high point on the plateau marked by a slightly more substantial cairn. Here I paused to have a snack and a coffee. Although the wind was light it was cold and I donned an extra layer to stay warm whilst I sat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46796933364/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7895/46796933364_e36d3120e4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had contemplated my route of the hill. Although the southern slopes would be much more gentle, there did appear to be a viable route dropping straight west from the summit area and it was this that I checked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47467990242/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh across Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7868/47467990242_bbd50c3cfe_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh across Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33643830498/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7897/33643830498_d46fed22a8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47469069612/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="From the Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7825/47469069612_13a3307025_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="From the Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the slopes were steep it was grassy and easy to negotiate down with care. I plunged straight down slope into the Lairig Luaidhe which dropped off to the right into Glen Lyon. Once at the bottom I crossed the allt and paused in the warm sunshine for a quick break before tackling the western slope. This was equally steep but topped out around 100m lower down than the Corbett so was over fairly quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47521791201/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="In the Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7858/47521791201_69713ff1f1_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="In the Lairig Luaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/40555804103/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7868/40555804103_8b474e84fc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/40556110103/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7855/40556110103_d351193466_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the views were dominated by Meall Ghaordaidh which was much closer by. I could see the line of the Cam Chreag ridge as it swung around to the south and then climbed up westward to meet Meall Ghoardaidh. Studying the route I noticed that there was one snowslope that was unavoidable but otherwise everything looked in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47522138931/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7852/47522138931_173a1cd13a_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33645206548/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Towards Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7809/33645206548_d52af9f9ec_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridge is wide, more of a series of lumpy plateaus that connect together and it was nice to amble along this quiet place in the sunshine. As I headed south the views now opened up across Glen Lochay and over to the distant Crianlarich hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/32579673817/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7836/32579673817_dd744079da_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47522168561/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Tarmachan Ridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7918/47522168561_4491d633c7_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Tarmachan Ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46607958065/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7914/46607958065_e8dc8c7710_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46607974935/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7900/46607974935_ee5d74007b_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn nan Oighreag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridge gradually rose and after passing over a series of small knolls and rocky outcroppings I found myself climbing up to the meet the northern arm of Meall Ghaordaidh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46799694514/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="On the East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7842/46799694514_bef53515dc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="On the East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33646615638/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Towards the Crianlarich Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7830/33646615638_161f28c1f8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards the Crianlarich Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/32581024007/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="On the East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7885/32581024007_7642d48c58_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="On the East Ridge of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I had a snowslope to cross but it was fairly shallow and so I put on microspikes and was quickly up. A pair of ptarmigan briefly crossed my path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/40557594143/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="North East side of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7853/40557594143_3d04f287c6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="North East side of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46799901404/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Ptarmigan on Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7809/46799901404_ee346566cf_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ptarmigan on Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/32581166177/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7890/32581166177_8cfb48b564_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33646795058/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Lawers Range"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7847/33646795058_ab1c2a74c3_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Lawers Range"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on grass again it was then an easy climb up the north ridge to the summit of the Munro. There were a couple already at the summit but they had taken their summit selfies and were just heading off as I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46799950384/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7874/46799950384_7fef4fac4e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46608347715/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Summit of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7913/46608347715_2cc221c0e9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit is quite lofty and offers excellent views all round. The wind continued to be light and so I found a nice sunny spot to lounge and enjoyed a relaxed lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47523658841/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Glen Lyon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7908/47523658841_237411f4c2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Lyon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46608359635/in/album-72157704366666372/" title="Summit of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7823/46608359635_379b9c9ba9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Meall Ghaordaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit there are excellent views down Glen Lochay towards Ben Challum and beyond it Ben Lui. Glen Lyon and its loch are spread out to the northwest and in the distance Ben Nevis was an obvious high point amongst the peaks of Lochaber. Closer by the Tarmachanc Ridge and Lawers range looked great in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long break on the summit I tore myself away from the mountain views and made my way off, this time following the well trodden baggers path down the southeast side of the hill. Initially this is quite interesting as it passes down through some crags and rocks, some of which were still holding deep snow. Beyond that though it was a somewhat boggy morass with the path often being entirely lost in the peat hags and general bog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the peat the ground dropped away again and it dried out. The path was on springy turf in places and I was soon almost back down at the vehicle track. I took the opportunity for one last break, leant against a large boulder overlooking the lairig with views to the morning’s Corbett and the Tarmachan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then a simple case of dropping down to the vehicle track and retracing my outward route back to the car where it felt very springlike in the warm sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 23rd March 2019&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 15.8km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 618m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5hrs 45mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Ben Chonzie (Munro, 931m)       &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Bright and sunny with a strong north-westerly wind   &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/259"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time since July 2017 I loaded up the car and headed out into the bright morning sunshine, on my way to the hills. Ben Chonzie near Crieff had long been on the list for a winter hill day and the conditions looked pretty promising for a good day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Ochils and Strath More to Crieff I soon found myself winding my way up the dam access road which is rough and potholed in places, requiring some care. At 8am I was the only one at the car park which shows how much less popular this route up the hill is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was blowing strongly down the reservoir turning the surface into an angry maelstrom. Ben Chonzie itself was shrouded in a snowy cloud but the closer hills were sunlit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47435423402/in/album-72157679601928758/" title="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7807/47435423402_5d8ced09ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path down the east bank of the reservoir makes for an easy but pleasant approach to the hills. It undulates along at first quite close to the water but then gradually climbs up and away from the shoreline. A couple of side streams were easily sloshed through and to my delight I saw that the strong wind was rapidly clearing the lingering cloud from the tops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46764995054/in/album-72157679601928758/" title="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7858/46764995054_bda88ae280_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the head of the reservoir I noticed a small group of swans circling. They flew in a nice v-formation before descending to the water. They joined quite a large group of birds who were enjoying the more sheltered end of the reservoir. In the pools along the track I would occasionally come across pockets of frogspawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping for a snack break I continued on, briefly pausing to consider tacking on Auchnafree Hill but thinking better of it. I left the reservoir behind and followed the track as it climbed up besides the moraine strewn glen to reach Lochan Uaine sitting below the encircling crags of Ben Chonzie's sunlit south eastern face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47435705592/in/photostream/" title="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7810/47435705592_40026d0026_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good track ended and it was just faint paths through the bog from here as I angled up towards the gap in the ridge between Below Biorach a' Mheannain and the bulk of Ben Chonzie. In this sheltered scoop below the crags it was warm in the sun and I had another refreshment break before tackling the steep final climb onto the hill. This was a pretty straightforward pull up alongside a small burn that topped out at a lingering snow patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47488618161/in/photostream/" title="Below Biorach a&amp;#x27; Mheannain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7831/47488618161_7fcf827624_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Below Biorach a&amp;#x27; Mheannain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/47435822362/in/photostream/" title="The crags of Ben Chonzie"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7810/47435822362_9e7596c61d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The crags of Ben Chonzie"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across this I got my first view of the hills to the north and the first blast of the sharp wind that was howling in from the northwest. This made progress up the final slopes to the top of the Munro fairly slow and arduous going. The views off to the Lawers hills opened up nicely though and I persevered until after a couple of false summits the top of Ben Chonzie came into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46765423124/in/photostream/" title="Biorach a&amp;#x27; Mheannain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7873/46765423124_1720e4b1c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Biorach a&amp;#x27; Mheannain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t seen anyone up to this point but at the top a couple of guys were hunkered down in the wind shelter built a few metres away from the diminutive cairn marking the top. I found a sheltered spot outside the wind break and got down out of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/33612215408/in/photostream/" title="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7870/33612215408_0a0fd32816_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Turret Reservoir"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views all around were excellent and I enjoyed an early lunch as I gazed off down to Loch Turret and to the nearby Loch Earn Munros. The two guys took summit photos and then headed off, leaving me alone on top. It would have been peaceful if not for the roar and snap of the wind as it gusted ferociously across the exposed ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/46765530174/in/photostream/" title="Lawers Range"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/7847/46765530174_a9ff154b7a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lawers Range"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I too was ready to head off and rather than retracing my steps headed off west along the broad plateau. A line of rusted fence posts and a series of cairns mark the way and I met increasing numbers of people heading for the summit. As I was mostly walking into the wind I had my hood drawn tight and was struggling to move forward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the higher ground as it turned to the south and soon enough left behind the bagger’s path coming up from Glen Lethnot. Instead a narrow path wound its way across peat hags to the minor lumpy summit of Meall an Seidhe. From here the eye was drawn to the sharp peak of Carn Chois ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was reached by following the path down through a marshy bealach and then up a steep slope which culminated in a rocky scramble up to the trig point. A family passed me coming the other way. From the top of Carn Chois there were excellent views off to the nearby Loch Earn Munros and further off to Glen Lochay which was shrouded by a wintry shower barrelling down from the northwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was thankfully shining where I was and on the far side of the trig point I found a comfortable hollow to shelter in. Out of the wind and in the sunshine it was pleasantly warm and I enjoyed a second lunch looking out across Comrie and to the distant Ochil Hills which were hazy silhouettes against the early afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I followed a narrow path which led me down to an airy perch looking directly down to the cold blue waters of the Loch Turret Reservoir, the track I had followed earlier a winding thread on the far side. It was a spectacular viewpoint and the sharpness of the drop-off enough to give me a tinge of vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were snow patches clinging to the precipitous edges and I gave these a wide berth as I contoured back around to pick up a descent route back down to the loch. A scooped coire on the southeast side of the hill provides a relatively gentle slope down although I took my time on the slick grass. A path emerged here and there and soon enough I was through a fence and heading down toward the shore where I picked up a vehicle access track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was relatively sheltered down by the water so I enjoyed a pleasant final stroll in the sunshine along to the dam. There was even more frogspawn in pools and puddles along this section. The spillway is an impressive piece of engineering and then it was a plod across the 160m wide dam to return to the car after a thoroughly enjoyable day on the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 9th May 2015&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 28.4km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,460m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Creag Mhor (Munro, 1,032m), Beinn Heasgarnich (Munro, 1,078m)    &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny with a cool breeze and occassional shower                     &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/436"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A half decent forecast had me packing my bag for a return journey down to the southeast of the Highlands. Last year Rich and I &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2014/03/glen-lochay/"&gt;abandoned an attempt at circuiting the Mamlorn hills&lt;/a&gt; around Glen Lochay. With just a day available (stormy weather was forecast to come in during the evening and set in for Sunday) I decided to focus my attention on the two Munros of Creag Mhor and Beinn Heasgarnich which sit on the north side of Glen Lochay, separating it from neighbouring Glen Lyon. These are bulky hills, craggy on their northern sides, separated by a low bealach but easy enough to combine. Despite recent snowfall and low temperatures I decided to leave boots, crampons and ice axe at home, figuring I was mostly avoiding north and eastern aspects and that the temperature was forecast to be fairly mild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant drive through the early sunshine listening to Out of Doors and then a dissection of the election results I wound my way down beautiful Glen Lochay to the parking area near Kenknock farm. A popular spot with several different hill options, the car park was almost full at just before 10am but I did manage to get a space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was soon off, following the easy going farm track besides the river and then through fields near the farm. Here there was a feeding station being used by a small herd of cows and calves. I was a little trepidatious making my way amongst them but they parted amicably enough and soon I was past the farm and at the crossroads where I look a left turn to climb up the northern side of the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18941623626" title="West down Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/503/18941623626_fc8a4a2823_c.jpg" width="800" alt="West down Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18345575264" title="On the road through Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/512/18345575264_a8701fa9dc_c.jpg" width="800" alt="On the road through Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track ultimately crosses over to the end of Loch Lyon but I only had to follow it up a few zig-zags until a smaller track branched off past the pipe inlet and followed the side of the glen westward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is excellent. Undulating slightly it offers grand views down over Glen Lochay to the southern hills of Meall a' Churain where Rich and I had descended the previous year. On the glen floor road a landrover made its slow way down the glen and ahead the eastern side of Ben Challum began to appear showing its interesting profile and plastered with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18968230895" title="Ben Challum above Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3872/18968230895_cefd25bc2b_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Ben Challum above Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18971291701" title="Sron nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3857/18971291701_40b2dfc694_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Sron nan Eun"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18347707753" title="Upper Glen Lochay and Ben Challum by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3760/18347707753_bc55abd118_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Upper Glen Lochay and Ben Challum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made quick progress and after a quick snack break by the Allt Bad a' Mhaim left the track and followed a muddy imprint up besides the stream towards the crags of Sron nan Eun, the hill which would lead me up to Creag Mhor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18782206399" title="East down Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/304/18782206399_153a1f95a6_c.jpg" width="800" alt="East down Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18347831613" title="Looking up Sron nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3708/18347831613_6a161be114_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Looking up Sron nan Eun"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prow of Sron nan Eun is guarded by crags but the slopes are grassier on the east side and so I followed the hill around until it was possible to ascend. The first obstacle was a new deer fence that required clambering over and then it was a matter of picking my way up the slope, avoiding the remnant snow patches that were still lying on steep ground. There were a lot of people about and I had groups both in front of and behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18782403649" title="Beinn Heasgarnich from Sron nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/298/18782403649_9b8054aa40_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Beinn Heasgarnich from Sron nan Eun"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18348050383" title="Crianlarich Hills and Ben Challum by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3697/18348050383_c09f24975a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Crianlarich Hills and Ben Challum"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I ascended the views started opening out with the pale blue thread of the River Lochay leading my eyes back to the snow of the western Lawers hills. To the southwest the high hills around Crianlarich were starting to become visible beyond the upper part of Glen Lochay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18942460046" title="Glen Lochay from Sron nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3726/18942460046_87ed043074_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Glen Lochay from Sron nan Eun"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18348141743" title="Upper Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3695/18348141743_8d61ca5245_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Upper Glen Lochay"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The level eased off and a pleasant ridge now led the eye towards Creag Mhor. There were still some snow patches on this southeastern side but it looked like they wouldn't pose any problem. I was soon following the clear path towards the Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18963448922" title="The ridge to Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/265/18963448922_5c3a35ceab_c.jpg" width="800" alt="The ridge to Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18348214003" title="Skies over Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3751/18348214003_428c330c6a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Skies over Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge climbed steadily towards the summit and soon there were glimpses down to Loch Lyon and further north to the hills of the Central Highlands away beyond Rannoch Moor. Off to my left, the big lump of Beinn Heasgarnich, the second hill for the day looked like it would be easily accessible by the long western ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overtook quite a few people as the slope steepened, the promise of good views drawing me on and soon I was rewarded for my efforts as I arrived at the summit, a cairn crowning a large outcropping of rock and boulders. The views were spectacular with excellent visibility and I took a long look out at the Ben Lui group of hills to the west and the Bridge of Orchy hills to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18781601890" title="Ben Lui hills from Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/543/18781601890_3b5b955281_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Ben Lui hills from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of people sat around the summit and as it was about lunchtime I found myself a quite place to seat and enjoy some food. I sat with my legs dangling over the northeastern face of the hill looking over to Beinn Heasgarnich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18346828534" title="Summit of Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3713/18346828534_9cf25d310e_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Summit of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18346858274" title="Beinn Heasgarnich from Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/438/18346858274_1a1b9e4556_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Beinn Heasgarnich from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch, and noticing that most people who had made the summit were now returning by the same route, I hoisted up my pack and left them all behind, descending down easy angled snow and boulder slopes in a northerly direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18943224216" title="Towards Ben Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3684/18943224216_a111196caa_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Towards Ben Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18964159912" title="North face of Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/467/18964159912_839eb2a84f_c.jpg" width="800" alt="North face of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intimidating crags of Creag Mhor were visible off to the right as I carefully picked my way down snow slopes, sticking to grass where possible. Across the low bealach was Beinn Heasgarnich. Behind me it looked like slightly more serious clouds were gathering as the skies darkened over the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18969557865" title="Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3732/18969557865_53b9bc3a71_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the bealach without much fuss and picked my way through the peat and pools to start the ascent up Sron Tairbh, the western arm of the Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18972729191" title="The eastern slopes of Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/507/18972729191_07e894f42a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="The eastern slopes of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light at this time was quite spectacular as a brief shower of hail passed by. It was short lived and was soon followed by sunshine cascading over the hills and blue skies above once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18972848631" title="Creag Mhor from Sron Tairbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/323/18972848631_2f62530a1a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Creag Mhor from Sron Tairbh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent was steep and occasionally pathless but as I reached higher up a path became clearer and I was soon making good progress with views down to Loch Lyon and back across the bealach to Creag Mhor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18782220510" title="Upper slopes of Sron Tairbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/439/18782220510_91223816d2_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Upper slopes of Sron Tairbh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep slope eased and I came out onto the wide ridge with a good view over to the actual summit, still some way off. The visibility was once again tremendous as the shower had passed by and fluffy white clouds now strung across the sky above the Crianlarich Hills and Ben Challum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18783968959" title="Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3718/18783968959_1f8edae0d1_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creag Mhor was now catching the sun and I could see tiny figures of walkers making their way back down its southern ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18973241971" title="Ben Challum and Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/287/18973241971_c12500c53a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Ben Challum and Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was quite a bit of snow in the hollows of the undulating ridge which culminated in the top of Stob an Fhir-Bhogha but it was all easy to negotiate and I was soon at the small cairn where the views to the Lawers range and the end of Loch Tay were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18349689143" title="Snow on  Stob an Fhir-Bhogha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/272/18349689143_5553e87ef7_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Snow on  Stob an Fhir-Bhogha"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18347785174" title="Crianlarich Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/277/18347785174_f8d2c80e6c_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Crianlarich Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creag Mhor still looked close but the way was clear now to the summit of Beinn Heasgarnich and the afternoon was excellent with a cool wind the worst of the weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18782742528" title="Creag Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3860/18782742528_80160594a1_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the undulating plateau as it wound its way around to the summit, soon arriving at the stony cairn which has excellent views to Lawers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18349961703" title="Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3904/18349961703_3828ec4fe8_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chap and his canine companion joined me and after a snack break I had a wander around the edges of the plateau taking in the views of the Bridge of Orchy hills beyond the end of Loch Lyon and further north to the white-capped peaks of the Rannoch Hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18783152180" title="Bridge of Orchy hills and Loch Lyon from Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/549/18783152180_c3c6ff4ac0_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Bridge of Orchy hills and Loch Lyon from Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long break in the sunshine I started to pick my way off the hill. The eastern slope was plastered in snow but it had plenty of give and after a quick glissade I was on easier ground and making my way down towards the north top on the far side of the grand Coire Sheasgarnaich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18965890052" title="Down the snowy east face of Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3822/18965890052_abfe0ef9ae_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Down the snowy east face of Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The going was rocky and uneven but I soon left the snow behind and enjoyed the interesting perspective on the bulky northern side of the Munro which is better seen from across Loch Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18785214809" title="The northern slopes of Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/412/18785214809_ae111b8a2a_c.jpg" width="800" alt="The northern slopes of Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now had a good perspective on the wide area of bog that gaurds the eastern approaches to the hill. There is no defined route but the line of the Allt Tarsuinn is a good handrail and I made my way down towards it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/18966326112" title="Boggy land east of Beinn Heasgarnich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/514/18966326112_a0777c76a8_c.jpg" width="800" alt="Boggy land east of Beinn Heasgarnich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was soon passing by the last of the serious snowbanks where tumbling clear waters were rapidly swelling into a stream. In the shelter of the hill's bulk it was warm and I stopped for a final snack break and the opportunity to replenish my water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then a simple matter of following the south bank of the Allt Tarsuinn where a faint path made the going better than expected. The afternoon was idyllic and I passed several perfect wild camping patches as the stream meandered its way between heathery knolls and lumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the stream dropped into a steeper sided cleft and started to drop quickly down towards Glen Lyon. I caught a glimpse of the dam and then left behind the Allt Tarsuinn to cut across boggy ground back to the Glen Lochay road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking a final look back up to Beinn Heasgarnich it was then a simple matter of following the road out. There was no traffic besides a few sheep and the views across Lochan Learg nan Lunn to the Glen Lochay hills were magical in the softer light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was soon dropping back down past the hydro pipe to the crossroads and then followed the road back past Kenknock farm to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 15-16th March 2014&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 33.44km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,033m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None        &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Mild, very strong winds, low cloud             &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/251"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial steep ascent up the east ridge of Sgiath Chuil the gradient eased for a moment. It was enough to give me a chance to take a rest and see what was coming next. Here at almost 900m in the teeth of 65mph winds whistling around from the northwest it was difficult to stand still, let alone stand up straight. I peered forward; through thick, swirling mist it was hard to discern the slopes. To my left snow-clad buttresses of rock seemed to arc out into the void. Directly above where I stood the ground steepened rapidly to a snow slope streaked with grimy fall lines. Glancing at the map confirmed we less than 100m from reaching the summit plateau but in those conditions it could have been 10m and we would have stood just as little chance of reaching it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich came up behind me and we retreated into the lee of a crag to discuss the situation. Our progress was much slower than expected and there were several miles of difficult terrain ahead before we would drop down and get out the wind. Weighing everything up - the terrain, the wind, the lack of views, and the proximity of an easy descent to the glen - we decided to turn around and leave the Munro for another day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’d left the car at the car park just east of Kenknock in Glen Lochay a few hours earlier. Although breezy at times on the drive over from Aberdeen it was mild and relatively calm as we booted up. After a slight delay involving forgotten poles we were away back down the road to the bridge crossing near Innischoarach. There was a slight scare when I found the pedestrian door padlocked closed but Rich spotted that the vehicle gate was open and so we soon through and following the hydro access track up the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7zQSn" title="Glen Lochay near Innischoarach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lochay near Innischoarach" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/13201637425_70b11559e4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going was easy and we chatted as we gained height with the views starting to open out further down Glen Lochay. Once away from the trees and riverside the breeze started to pick up and by the time we reached the top of the hydro road it was very blustery indeed. Behind us the upper slopes of the Munro Meall Ghaordaidh disappeared up into the cloud. Towards Beinn Hearsganaich though there were patches of sunlight although it seemed like the higher tops were all attracting their covering of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7AacM" title="Towards the Lairig nan Lunn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Lairig nan Lunn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/13201699103_a08b534f09_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took to the hillside, following the rise of the land as it led us towards the broad ridge on the west side of the Allt Dhubhchlair. Below the snowline it was boggy but we picked a way up, following the odd deer track, reluctantly drawing closer to the ever present cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7ApV4" title="The Allt Dubhchlair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Allt Dubhchlair" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2846/13201748593_8b4c1e45ba_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind strengthened even more as we got towards the shoulder leading up towards the start of the ridge above Coire Dhubhchlair. Shreds of mist were being torn across the ridgeline and it looked less than inviting. Patches of brown, wintered grass were separated by patches of snow. These proved to yield easily to a kicked boot but it was slow going, fighting against the wind and the underfoot conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7zqLK" title="The ridge above Coire Dhubhchlair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The ridge above Coire Dhubhchlair" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2797/13201556363_930e3da583_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slowly we rose into the cloud and lost all views, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other and fighting to stay upright in the gusting wind. It was a relief when the ridge finally gave out to a broader plateau and we could take some shelter. The wind was incredibly strong, blowing us around and our progress was slow but we decided to continue along the ridge towards Sgiath Chuil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrain was complex and the wind made it difficult to stay on any kind of bearing. It was a GPS navigation kind of day as we followed the rise and fall of the wide ridge, sometimes crossing extensive snowpatches, other times making good progress down grassy slopes. Every time we were exposed to the north or west it was a struggle to stand. Eventually we drew towards the next bealach and as we descended the slight improvement in visibility showed we had strayed too far south and were about to get into steep snow slopes. We backtracked a short way and picked up a better route, dropping down to the bealach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts that we might be sheltered here were dashed and our plans for the evening changed towards definitely seeking the shelter of the glen for a campsite, anywhere up high was going to be a non-starter. The slopes to the right looked nice and gentle and we quietly filed away the easy escape route from the high ground before continuing west, looking to make it towards our first Munro of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrain here is complex and initially I thought we would be better heading south to pick up gentler slopes. However the ridge rose up from the bealach and seemed to offer a good way up. We started the climb, making our way up the steep slopes as the wind gradually increased again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the circumstances retreat was the sensible option. After double checking the escape route back down from the bealach we paused for some lunch. It had been several hours of hard work with very little opportunity to stop and take on energy. We reluctantly retreated, picking our way back down the ridge and to the bealach were the gentle fall of the land guided us downward through an utterly white world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape route worked out perfectly and we were able to amble downward somewhat sheltered from the wind. It had been disappointing to get so close to the summit ridge and retreat but given the booming of the wind above us still felt the right decision. The snow slopes began to break up and gaping chasms started to appear as the rush of water below told a story of rapid snowmelt. We gingerly crossed a couple of these to reach the heather on the east side of the Allt Innis-Daimh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FInally we were below the clag the views were restored, sunshine still teasingly handing over Glen Lochay. Here we stopped for a proper lunchbreak, enjoying the much improved conditions and looking across to the pass leading to Glen Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7zGmT" title="Rainbow over Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over Glen Lochay" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3665/13201608803_d978ce3414_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hadn't descended much further when a new obstacle stopped us. The burns were in spate, snowmelt swelling them to torrents of white water. We scouted out downstream and then upstream but it took a while to find a safe crossing point. From here we followed the burn down towards the hydro intake and down towards the access road as the sunshine turned golden; the day was advancing and  we realised just how long it had taken to cover the short distance we had managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7Af6q" title="Rich seeking a crossing point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rich seeking a crossing point" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/13201715554_fb53ec27e4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stopped above the intake and plantation to admire the crepuscular rays breaking over the winding thread of silver that marked the River Lochay running down the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7tjWx" title="Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lochay" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3753/13200366075_a35c529079_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was down the zig-zagging road to reach the glen floor itself where we assumed we could make rapid progress down to a planned campsite away west below the slopes of Ben Challum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7uaMC" title="Rays over Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rays over Glen Lochay" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2848/13200530394_5b1a42ab85_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were now on a vehicle track winding its way westward through the glen and whilst we expected progress to be easier now, it turned out to not quite be the case. The wind was still incredibly strong here in the open glen and we were walking face into it, once again struggling at times to put one foot in front of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ticked off the various landmarks of the glen, plantations and farms, stopping occasionally to watch the torrents of white water pouring off the hillside. The sun gradually faded as a gloomy grey cloud drifted in from the west. The snow-speckled peaks grew closer, circling around the head of the glen and guiding us towards our end point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7s6PT" title="Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lochay" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2767/13200126845_8923422c11_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7yirr" title="Ben Challum and the River Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Challum and the River Lochay" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2804/13201336583_7bd820afb7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before the Allt Challum we started to look around for a sheltered spot to pitch the tents. It was frustratingly open but after some searching we finally settled on a spot that was slightly less boggy and with some protection from the gusting wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tents were up quickly and it was a relief to finally get into somewhere truly sheltered from the wind. The evening passed pleasantly with cuppas, dinner, chatting and a final hot chocolate before retiring to the sleeping bag for a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it had been much calmer during the evening the wind strengthened in the night. The tent shook under its force and you could hear the gusts booming further down the glen.  Our semi-sheltered position didn't lead to any damage but it wasn't exactly the most undisturbed night of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7qvkd" title="Camping in Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping in Glen Lochay" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3808/13199815694_763a068156_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning dawned. Though there were scraps of blue sky above the glen it was clear the high tops remained shrouded in cloud, and the wind had strengthened in the night and was blowing just as hard. After our experiences the previous day we knew it was futile to try and get anywhere near a Munro so we made the decision to retrace our steps down the glen and back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/m7tu9Q" title="Rainbow in Glen Lochay by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow in Glen Lochay" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/13200397064_8fef93556e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we packed up and enjoyed walking with our wind to our backs at last. We made good progress in the warming glen, stopping to chat to a couple of folk who were braving the elements. Beyond the plantation there was another group (who tried for one of the Munros but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realandyblack/status/445694635256872961"&gt;turned back just short of the top&lt;/a&gt;) and then, near Lubchurran, a hillwalking club who appeared to have just forded the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant amble east we were back at the car around 11am and enjoyed a relaxed drive through the breezy sunshine back to Aberdeen with a break for a delicious lunch at the Watermill in Aberfeldy. The wind never eased but there was plenty of sunshine around and Loch Tay in particular looked dramatic with the light skipping off its choppy waters.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="wild camping"></category><category term="mamlorns"></category></entry><entry><title>A Round of Loch an Daimh</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/03/loch-an-daimh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-03T20:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-03-03T20:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-03-03:/blog/2013/03/loch-an-daimh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A high level route around Loch an Daimh in Highland Perthshire taking in the Munros of Stuchd and Lochain and Meall Buidhe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago Fraser put up &lt;a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/loch-an-daimh-overnighter/"&gt;his report of a weekend trip around Loch an Daimh&lt;/a&gt; in Highland Perthshire and I immediately added the round to my to-do list. From this initial idea I spread out the map and picked out a slightly extended route that, rather than dropping to the end of the loch to camp as Fraser had, stayed high so that the addition of the two Corbetts was possible without much loss of height. I had a few vague ideas for camp spots but decided to see how far I got on the day and then make a final decision as to whether to camp higher up or find a more sheltered spot lower down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago Fraser put up &lt;a href="http://mcalisterium.wordpress.com/2011/04/26/loch-an-daimh-overnighter/"&gt;his report of a weekend trip around Loch an Daimh&lt;/a&gt; in Highland Perthshire and I immediately added the round to my to-do list. From this initial idea I spread out the map and picked out a slightly extended route that, rather than dropping to the end of the loch to camp as Fraser had, stayed high so that the addition of the two Corbetts was possible without much loss of height. I had a few vague ideas for camp spots but decided to see how far I got on the day and then make a final decision as to whether to camp higher up or find a more sheltered spot lower down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e26QGH" title="Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8545093873_576d97aba0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After a bit of faffing I was on the road by 9am and despite numerous diversions arrived at the end of Loch an Daimh at almost exactly midday. The drive up Glen Lyon is glorious and only gets better as you get further in. I’d previously been down here in May 2009 to climb the &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/05/munros-north-of-glen-lyon/"&gt;four Munros above Invervar&lt;/a&gt;. The drive from Aberdeen had been sunny but by Aberfeldy the cloud, coming in from the west, had taken over and it was chilly at the 400m high dam road where I parked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2crXd" title="The dam at Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The dam at Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8546188014_f0a347202a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a sandwich and a hot drink I got my kit sorted, finding a cunning way to attach my crampon bag to my backpack, and then heading off along the metalled road which loops up through the woods below the Giorra dam to eventually emerge right on the lip of the reservoir. Still largely frozen, the loch provided a smooth grey backdrop to the initial steep climb up to the eastern ridge of Creag an Fheadain. This climb was the toughest part of the whole trip. Ice covered the well-worn track and so I scrambled up on tussock and heather beside it until I reached the snowline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e26TwZ" title="Looking over the Giorra Dam to Glen Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking over the Giorra Dam to Glen Lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8232/8545103401_f47f12f2c6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although sets of deep bootprints arced up skyward from here I decided to put my crampons on and swapped out my walking poles for the axe. Below me there was nothing to stop a fall until the loch waters. Properly equipped I safely made the ascent of the upper slopes to reach the ridge. A steep climb up compacted snow brought me to the bleak summit of Creag an Fheadain where I got my first view of Stuchd an Lochain, the summit cone wreathed in cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2cxu5" title="Glen Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8249/8546206624_20b59e670f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There followed an enjoyable wander around the lip of the coire, admiring the impressive cornices and wondering whether the cloud would shift at all. Finally, as I plodded up another steep snow slope to the summit it did indeed and though there was still mist around, the views opened up with the skeletal forms of snow-streaked mountains emerging all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e274Ct" title="Cornicing on the ridge to Stuchd an Lochain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cornicing on the ridge to Stuchd an Lochain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8365/8545137359_2571edcc9d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit of Stuchd an Lochain, my first Munro of 2013, was a quiet place and I took some time to snack and hydrate, peering out through the mist to the great cornices which hung over the northern edge. The north ridge of the mountain looks fun and away to the west the rest of the day’s route was unfolding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e27dtF" title="Stuchd an Lochain's summit cairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stuchd an Lochain's summit cairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8545167125_2eafb01eaf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e27ge4" title="Rannoch Moor beyond Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rannoch Moor beyond Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8384/8545176369_5598112f46_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the southern and western slopes there was barely any snow and so freed from the crampons I made quick progress down to the minor top of Meallan Odhar. On the way the sun briefly appeared and this certainly lifted the spirit. Ahead of me I could see across Rannoch Moor to the gates of Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e27j62" title="The hills above Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills above Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8545185995_61ff1ab069_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2defs" title="Cornices on the north side of Stuchd an Lochain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cornices on the north side of Stuchd an Lochain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8546340394_876b2a9a75_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Meallan Odhar there is a deep cut-in as a narrow coire rises up from the loch to a bealach. I wound my way across to the bealach where I found it sheltered and with plenty of flowing water. This then would be my backup plan for a pitch. However with plenty of daylight remaining I now ascended the long slope of the Corbett Sron a’ Choire Chnapanaich enjoying the views back up Loch an Daimh and back across to Stuchd an Lochain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e27Cx4" title="Descending from Meallan Odhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descending from Meallan Odhar" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8106/8545248057_002382fe90_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2dkAf" title="Summit of Cnap a' Choire Chnapanaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Cnap a' Choire Chnapanaich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8531/8546361726_a8c41dbfda_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e27HJX" title="The bealach to Creag a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The bealach to Creag a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8374/8545265567_71a69104c2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather was now closing back in again and as the mist started to fall I took a bearing off the Corbett, heading for the next bealach which would lead me on to a smaller summit that should have a commanding view over Loch Lyon. This was my planned camp spot. In the hollow the snow was deep and soft but I was soon climbing up to the flat summit of Creag a’ Chaorainn where a number of cairns all seemed to be highest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2dmnY" title="The steep drop to Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The steep drop to Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8111/8546364378_5df44aa08c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2dmFN" title="Loch Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8546365412_66b7e2a981_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the cloud returned any breeze seemed to have dropped and so it was easy to locate a flatish pitch for the tent, just beyond the summit and with a view down Loch Lyon a couple of paces from the door. Just as I got the tent up a sleety drizzle started up and so I quickly gathered some water a got inside to enjoy a cup of hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e2dnAf" title="Wild camping above Glen Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camping above Glen Lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8090/8546368454_e56b4a1914_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, after dinner, and as a soft orange glow spread out from the Central Belt, a gap in the clouds gave me an opportunity to take my mat and sleeping bag outside and lie down gazing up into a starry sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dZjk3D" title="Somebody left the lights on by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Somebody left the lights on" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8252/8524897573_4dd366c103_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night was utterly still and so I slept with the door open and tied back. Another patch of drizzle must have passed through sometime before dawn because the ground was sodden when I finally roused, woken by the diffuse light rather than my alarm. Coffee and porridge were consumed watching mist drift over Loch Lyon and by 8am I was packed and away for a long day heading along the north side of Loch an Daimh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3uLoZ" title="Mist over Loch Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Loch Lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8512/8560883461_b11c0799df_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conditions were looking promising, with some cloud clinging to the higher tops but a weak sun already starting to find its way through chinks in the cloud. From my overnight spot I had a brief descent down snowy slopes before picking up a rib of the next Corbett, Meall Buidhe which sits at the extreme western end of the circuit. The going was easy and warmed me up nicely as the sun developed over the Mamlorns above Loch Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3AsrE" title="Loch lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch lyon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8509/8561993736_786f1da00c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaining the ridge brought new views of the Loch an Daimh hills and over a Rannoch Moor covered in drifting cloud. I headed west and then turned south for the summit of the Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3uSkt" title="Climbing Meall Buidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Meall Buidhe" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8560903441_eec8ea00d7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a snack, watching a couple of Ptarmigan wandering around on the snow patches and enjoying the increasingly sunny views to the Bridge of Orchy Hills and the more distant Black Mount. A few snow showers drifted over the Mamlorns and there was a cold feel to the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3Az5A" title="Clouds over Rannoch Moor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds over Rannoch Moor" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8562016062_3da2145378_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked my way carefully off Meall Buidhe, drifting westward to avoid cornicing and crags on the slopes immediately above the stream that would eventually fall into Loch an Daimh. The cloud over Rannoch Moor was lifting and soon there seemed to be blue skies all around, including to the east where I could follow the line of the hills off to Meall Buidhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3AAzf" title="The long ridge north of Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The long ridge north of Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8228/8562021088_35eab17b5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low temperatures meant the ground was firm and I made good progress across the heather. Occasionally a track would appear only to disappear at the next band of rocky ground. Ahead of me the views to the previous day’s hills were developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3uYLR" title="The hills south of Loch an Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills south of Loch an Daimh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8560925097_286fb44458_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rounded summit of Creag Riabhach was reached and now the views were developing northward to the hills around Loch Ericht. Closer by the trench of Loch an Daimh now gave views across to the shapely summit of Stuchd an Lochain. A happy snack break was taken watching amber sunlight dance and weave across Rannoch Moor, teasing me with views of the Buchaille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next summit was Meall Cruinn, which required a diversion from the track which was now much clearer as I approached the Munro. The flat summit of Meall Buidhe seemed close at hand now although in reality there was still plenty of heathery ups and downs to negotiate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My route now took a large, mostly unnecessary zig-zag as I crossed to a top off to the north first, and then one to the south. From the former I got views of the end of Loch Rannoch whilst the later provided the first expansive views of this side of Loch an Daimh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon though I was back on course, and was soon making my way up the final slopes to join the trade route on Meall Buidhe. All of a sudden, and after 24 hours of seeing no-one, there were people everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3ALsf" title="Glencoe across Rannoch Moor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glencoe across Rannoch Moor" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8095/8562054322_3534edf005_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way along the gentle ground to Meall Buidhe’s summit cairn. Here the draw of this otherwise unremarkable summit was immediately recognised as I spun 360 degrees to marvel at a panorama of mountain scenery. Schiehallion off to the east, Ben Alder to the north, Glencoe beyond Rannoch Moor to the west and south to the Crianlarich Hills and Lawers group. It was fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way back to the car was now straightforward, following the bagger’s route off the south side of the hill to descend almost directly to the car back at the dam. On the way I chatted to a couple of folk, including a fellow Aberdonian and bumped into the famous Collie, Molly, the first dog to climb all the Corbetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise the descent, on springy turf following an easy track, was straightforward and I enjoyed the developing views of Loch an Daimh as I got lower down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the car it was good to change out of my heavy boots (the crampons hadn’t been worn again since the ascent the previous day!) and then head homeward, the sound of the new Frightened Rabbit accompanying me along the twists and turns of Glen Lyon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hillwalking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="loch"></category><category term="winter"></category><category term="snow"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>The Tarmachan Ridge</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/09/the-tarmachan-ridge/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-16T19:16:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-09-16T19:16:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-09-16:/blog/2012/09/the-tarmachan-ridge/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A round of the Tarmachan Ridge above Killin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 15th September 2012&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 14.23km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 933m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 4 hrs 30 mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Creag na Caillich, Beinn nan Eanach, Meall Garbh, Meall nan Tarmachan (Munro)
Weather: Early sunshine and breezy to later on low cloud and very strong winds
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/trip/369"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick drive north east took us to Killin and up the road to our high starting point for the day. We passed the new and very busy Ben Lawers car park to reach the Tarmachan starting point which only had a couple of cars parked up at this relatively early hour. Although the clouds had earlier been stuck to the summits, we booted up in bright sunshine with a blustery breeze blowing the long grasses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick drive north east took us to Killin and up the road to our high starting point for the day. We passed the new and very busy Ben Lawers car park to reach the Tarmachan starting point which only had a couple of cars parked up at this relatively early hour.

&lt;p&gt;Given the westerly wind we chose to reverse the traditional route, and so headed along the landrover track westward, the Tarmachan ridge opening up above us. A workgroup was spotted putting in new plantings but they were the last people we would see for a good long while - the western end of the hill was deserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddmMmX" title="Early cloud over Meall nan Tarmachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Early cloud over Meall nan Tarmachan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8301/8016134003_5203a19c90_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed the early morning sunlight that was illuminating Loch Tay and Killin and gazed hopefully up at the ridge as the cloud gradually burned off. A couple of forks took us gradually higher up the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddmUqq" title="The Tarmachan Ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Tarmachan Ridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8319/8016157752_a2eeb69e47_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track wound its way gently up the hillside until we reached the ruins of the old quarry. Here there was no sign of a continuing path and so we took to the open hillside, picking a vague line of least resistance and aiming for the low point in the ridge some distance off at the head of the coire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddn1Ar" title="Creag na Caillich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creag na Caillich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8295/8016178517_414bb7eecc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The craggy slopes of Creag na Caillich now stood off to our left as we made our way past small streams and over some wide patches of peat and bog. The ascent was much easier than expected and after a steepish climb up the head wall of the coire we finally emerged on the ridge just short of the summit of Creag na Caillich. My uncle and I continued up to reach our first summit of the day. From here we had a stunning view of the Tarmachan Ridge opening up in front of us. A little cloud lingered, particularly over Meall nan Tarmachan itself but we still were enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we returned to where my aunt was waiting before continuing eastward along the ridge. It is a delightful walk and the views continued to be expansive, particularly over the wild, empty glens to the north of us. There was a steep pull up a zigzag track and then we on the summit of Beinn nan Eachan where the cloud finally caught up with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of the sun and with a strong wind blowing we rapidly got some extra layers on. A group of four Geordies arrived and told us of their interesting day out on the Lawers range the day before when they had been forced to crawl off the summit amidst a howling gale. The wind was strong today, but thankfully not that strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With outer layers and warm hats on we continued east, following the ridge down to the col before the impressive climb up to Meall Garbh. This has the infamous scrambly section which we would be climbing up rather than sliding down. The rock was damp and slippery and it took me a bit of time to locate e best route of ascent. Eventually though I emerged at the top of the crag and rejoined my aunt and uncle who had sensibly taken the steep bypass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed up and then followed the narrow arete along to the prominent top of Meall Garbh. In the wind it was an interesting place to try and stand, offering views east to Meall nan Tarmachan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the far side of Meall Garbh we found a sheltered spot to stop for lunch. We had been making good progress but the weather still looked to be getting ahead of us and so after a sandwich and some crisps we headed off, now making the final descent to the col before ascending the gentle slopes of Meall nan Tarmachan and the only Munro of the round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turned out we spent the least amount of time on the highest summit. By some freak of geography it turned out that we had been largely sheltered from the true wind strength through the course of the day. Only when we emerged on the summit of the Munro did we find out just how windy it was. We could barely stand still to take a quick summit photo and so we moved off rapidly, getting just enough of a break to note that the cloud had descended over Lawers and was rapidly shrouding the ridge over which we had just passed .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly made our way off the summit, passing a large family outing replete with numerous children and dogs, and then making our way down the excellent track to Meall nan Tarmachan’s south-east top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddnV5i" title="Cloud over Ben Lawers by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over Ben Lawers" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8030/8016355061_b1e3f70daa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track made for a rapid descent and although Meall nan Tarmachan was now shrouded in mist there was sunlight elsewhere, finding its way through gaps in the cloud to send rays down over Killin and Glen Lochay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ddnZEe" title="Sunlight over Killin by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight over Killin" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8461/8016370485_7683b8dfc6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind remained ferocious even as we lost height but the light was superb as afternoon crept onwards and we got closer and closer to Loch Tay. Ahead of us the cloud once again started to part from the Ben Lawers group of hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path eventually met the outward vehicle track and then it was just a short stretch back to the car with the sight of Lairige Dam dwarfed by Meall Corranaich an impressive sight. Out of boots we had a quick run up to the lochan to look at the impressive eastern buttresses of Meall nan Tarmachan and then it was a pleasant drive back in the late afternoon sunshine to Stirling for a relaxed evening with lovely food and company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The east coast sparkled with a heavy frost as I drove down the A90 early on Sunday morning. A thin mist filled the hollows and the sun, rising through a bank of sea fog, cast an ethereal light across the landscape. The colours were crisper and more vivid than anything you could hope to commit to film or chip. After seemingly weeks of wind and rain the utter stillness was quite breathtaking, even when travelling at 70mph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the loops in the river at Coupar Angus the cows stood stiffly, their breath coming in rising clouds of vapour. The high ground between Meikleour and Dunkeld was icy, the fields white with a thick frost, and my car thermometer quickly sank into negative degrees. I took it easy on the slippery roads and then as I dropped down into the Tay valley I descended into a thick mist. Dunkeld was an eerie ghost town, the river barely visible below the strong stone arches of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thick mist accompanied me on the short blast up the A9 and through Aberfeldy. At Kenmore, Loch Tay was completely shrouded and it wasn’t until I started to gain height on the road to Killin that I saw scraps of blue sky above me. Elated I turned off the main road onto the narrow single track that winds up and over the pass to Glen Lyon and suddenly after climbing out of the trees I was &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the cloud and once again in glorious sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6323426340"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hidden Loch Tay" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6233/6323426340_865b567097_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the crest of the pass there used to be a National Trust for Scotland visitor centre. Sadly today it is a muddy pit with various heavy plant items poised over the ruins like ragged crows. All this work is &lt;a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/news/ben-lawers-car-park-and-glen-ogle-road-closure/005280/"&gt;supposed to result in a new car park opening in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the current loss of this parking area, the landrover track which runs to the start of the Tarmachan ridge track is now the favoured spot and the good weather had brought out plenty of folk. I squeezed my car in near the gate and got myself sorted in the crisp morning air. The sunshine was great and I decided to leave my winter jacket behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6327244630"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Ghlas" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6056/6327244630_bb2ff5235d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  views, even here at the base of the hills, were tremendous. The whole of Loch Tay was covered in a thick blanket of cloud but above me the skies were blue, flecked by white, wispy cirrus clouds. The mountains shone in the sunshine. Above me loomed the pock-marked bulk of Meall nan Tarmachan, and in the distance I had a good view of the distant coned summit of Beinn Ghlas. I followed the road back down to the car park, bog hopped the muddy expanse (it is best to stick to the very right and follow the slightly firmer ground adjacent to the fence) and soon picked up the boardwalks which form part of the Ben Lawers nature trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6329212699"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lawers Nature Reserve" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6212/6329212699_a62a1cb90d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing steadily uphill on a good track, and with the sun beating down, it was soon warm and I was down to just my base layer. The track follows the course of the burn, crossing it below a water intake and then rising up on the southern bank until you reach the end of the fenced off enclosure. I passed a couple of folk and then stopped to put back on my jacket as once out on the open hillside there was a chill wind which started to cool me down. I followed the path which branches off and climbs up to Beinn Ghlas. There are a couple of false summits but each one gave increasingly grand views back over Loch Tay, across to the neighbouring hills, and to mountains further afield which were above the cloud. In places cloud was lapping at flanks and occassionaly covering summits but here there was nothing but blue skies and endless views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed a few more people just as I got to the summit plateau of Beinn Ghlas. People often deride this hill as a mere bump on the way to Ben Lawers, but to my mind, in these conditions it had a great character all of its own. High up at 1,100m there was a thick frost covering the shadowy northern slopes and the views now included Glen Lyon and the hills north that encircle Rannoch Moor. I spent a good while sitting in the lee of the summit breathing in all this. It seemed an age since I had had a genuinely good day on the hills (in fact it was this Sunday morning back in June…) and I was here to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away to the east a broad ridge wound its way down to the bealach below Ben Lawers. The path was excellent making for good progress and soon I was ascending the steep slopes of this southern giant. At 1,214m, Ben Lawers is amongst the highest mountains in the southern Scottish Highlands. There is a good path though which has been reinforced in places to reduce the effects of erosion on this popular and busy route. I arrived at the airy summit and found I had it all to myself. The trig point stands on an island of crumbling concrete, whilst adjacent to it is a constructed cairn. The views from the summit were magnificent. To the north west I could see Beinn a’ Ghlo, the Glas Tulaichan hills and beyond them the broad backs of the Cairngorms. Away to the northwest across the empty space of Rannoch Moor I could see the Buchaille guarding the entrance to Glen Coe. Nearer were all the hills surrounding Crianlarich and south the Loch Earn Munros were clear of the earlier cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a cuppa and some food and enjoyed looking down the precipitous slopes to Coire nan Cat. &lt;a href="/blog/2011/03/the-clouds-lie-above-coire-nan-cat/trackback/"&gt;Earlier in the year&lt;/a&gt; I had tramped across the hills on the far side of the Coire in less than perfect conditions so it was great to see the whole round clear. There were people on all the summits as far as I could see. Tentatively I looked over at An Stuc and its north ridge to see how confident I felt about following it down into the glen containing the Allt a' Chobhair – a possible way of turning this standard out-and-back into a more circular affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6329239643"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds fill Strath Tay" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6031/6329239643_2bcdc693ed_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the weather still as good as ever I continued on, following the steep slopes that drop down to Crag an Fhithich and hence to the bealach with An Stuc where I had dropped off on the previous visit. Again there is another steep climb up though soon enough the gradient eases and then it is an easy stroll along to the summit cairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6333328931"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Stuc from Creag an Fhithich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6046/6333328931_f769a60524_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly I had the summit to myself for quite a while, despite there being plenty of people on neighbouring Meall Greigh, and back on Ben Lawers. The views north to the Glen Lyon hills, Schiehallion and beyond were superb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6333332291"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan nan Cat from An Stuc" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6033/6333332291_50a9721bfa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some more time contemplating the circular route but ultimately decided to take the more assured course of returning back the way I had come. Though a circular route is always preferable there were a couple of unknowns that didn’t merit the risk on a short winter day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my lunch on An Stuc, chatted to a guy who came up to the summit and was also set to return back to Ben Lawers and eventually tore myself away from the superb vantage point. Turning west I now retraced my outward steps, gaining the opportunity to enjoy the views all over again, this time with different light as the sun sank westward and the shadows lengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on Ben Lawers it was a lot busier now as plenty of people gathered on the summit enjoying the fine day. This included a group of enthusiastic Polish people who were cheering on the final member of their party, still toiling up the track. I sat for some time in the warm sunshine, enjoying the views as the sun caught the distant haze, bathing different hills and mountains in an ever changing array of colours and shades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6333343717"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creag an Fhithich, An Stuc and Meall Garbh" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6226/6333343717_bfa065aff1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I had to tear myself away and move on back towards Beinn Ghlas. Although an obvious path drops down to avoid the summit the route is on the north slopes of the mountain which had been in shade all day and were therefore heavily frosted. From a distance it looked a little slippery and so I chose to stick to the ridge and the areas where the sun had warmed the ground. This gave me chance to revisit the summit of Beinn Ghlas, taking in the views down Loch Tay to where Killin was now free of the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6334105494"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over the Southern Highlands" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6231/6334105494_eb3a8769df_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit I got a good view of a paraglider catching some thermals above the western flanks of the hill, his red sail glowing in the low sun. Sadly, despite the low angle, there was still another hour or more until sunset so I decided reluctantly to press on, giving myself some time to get through the mist whilst there was still daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6334112780"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_2464" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6043/6334112780_924ef51a9e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path off Beinn Ghlas, once the steeper upper parts are negotiated, is delightful and gives a very quick descent down to the allt and the start of the nature reserve. After one final cuppa and a bite to eat here I continued on, following the good track back to the car park and then back up to the car. The light was amazing, the sky filled with every shade of indigo and violet and blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6335706060"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben More and Stob Binnein" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6105/6335706060_63947bf064_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6334954221"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Lawers Nature Reserve" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6033/6334954221_d26a685a5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I drove back alongside the loch I dipped in and out of the cloud. Every time I rose above it the views behind me were better with the sunlight giving amazing texture to the sea of cloud. Above it all were the twin horns of Ben More and Stob Binein, dark against the setting sun. Sadly there aren’t many places to stop on this fast road and so I only got one chance to get a photo. After that the road dropped down towards Kenmore and I was once more back in thick cloud. Fog lights came on as visibility was seriously reduced and it was a careful pace that eventually got me to Aberfeldy. Rejoining the A9 was one of the worst moments but thankfully everyone was being sensible and had pulled over into the outside lane to let vehicles merge into the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6334957589"&gt;&lt;img alt="Final view of Beinn Ghlas" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6211/6334957589_0c31b7bc19_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once through a grey and misty Dunkeld I rose back out of the cloud and thankfully had much improved visibility for the drive back up the A90 to a fish supper, a beer and home. Good days have been rare on the hills since the late spring but I think today might just have made up for at least a few weekends worth of rain and clouds and wind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a long drive to Tillicoultry from Aberdeen. This fact prompted the first 7am start of the 2011 calendar for the Stocket Hillwalking Club, but luckily it didn't seem to dissuade members or guests from turning out in healthy numbers. The long day would be rewarded with sunshine, piercingly cold winds, and snow, lots of snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a long drive to Tillicoultry from Aberdeen. This fact prompted the first 7am start of the 2011 calendar for the Stocket Hillwalking Club, but luckily it didn't seem to dissuade members or guests from turning out in healthy numbers. The long day would be rewarded with sunshine, piercingly cold winds, and snow, lots of snow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The drive was broken by a brief stop for enormous bacon butties at The Horn, just beyond Dundee, where legs were stretched underneath crisp blue skies. Unfortunately as we travelled further south and west towards the Central Belt, the skies gradually filled with a low lying blanket of grey cloud. By the time we were driving through Tillicoultry the summits of the southern Ochils were all shrouded in a thick layer of mist that didn't look to have much intention of shifting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the long bus ride everyone was raring to go and we were soon threading our way through the back streets of Tillicoultry until we headed up towards Mill Glen. Initially we came to a halt when it turned out that the lower path through the steep-sided glen is currently closed due to dangers of erosion and rockfall. We retraced our steps, finding the higher path which soon had us climbing steeply above the dramatic gorge-like glen down which the Mill Burn tumbles. To our left we had views of the large quarry that has been cut into the lower slopes of Wood Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551080535"&gt;&lt;img alt="The path from Tillicoultry" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5148/5551080535_7d0a7d686a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551076277"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quarry above Tillicoultry" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5551076277_f3ba6a5e35_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contouring around to the foot of The Law was fun, the path edging precariously around above a steep drop, and was followed by a scrambly descent to a bridge across the Gannel burn. From here a steep re-ascent took us onto the southern shoulder of The Law where we encountered the first patches of old snow. It was fascinating to be but a few minutes walk from the centre of a reasonably large town and yet feel so out in the wilds, but such is the strange and beguiling nature of the Ochils, particularly on this southern side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551666506"&gt;&lt;img alt="First sight of The Law" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5551666506_8f3a545a09_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551090043"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Law" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5551090043_9dc2c3d803_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb quickly took us into the mist, obscuring views back to the shimmering line of the Forth behind us. The tiny trig point came as welcome relief from the viewless climb but I didn't hang around there long as the wind was very strong and deeply cold, carrying the feel of snow and ice on it. The final slopes up to the summit had been through deep snow. On the east side, sheltered from the wind, the snow was a bit softer and there was a pause here for tea and food whilst everyone regrouped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551096047"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of The Law" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5301/5551096047_2399933c5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first to arrive I had the longest wait, but it was worth it as by the time we were ready to depart, the clouds were blowing through and bright patches of sunlight began to illuminate the surrounding hills. By the time we started to make our way along the connecting ridge between The Law and the col below Ben Cleuch there was bright sunshine and stunning views north and east into the heart of the Ochils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deep snow made the going tough and we stuck to single file, driving a good furrow along what was already a well trodden ridgeline. The route follows the line of a new looking fence; these seem to be something of a feature up on these hills for we would be following or crossing them for a great part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5541973151"&gt;&lt;img alt="The clouds part" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5541973151_272e41dce6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gentle ascent of Ben Cleuch offered more snowy delights, with the added pleasure of views across the wide snowy range of hills running north into Perthshire. Two of the windfarms which sit deep in the heart of the Ochils were now visible, their white arms spinning gracefully in the strong wind. The skies were now a bold and brilliant blue, setting off the pristine white snow perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the summit of Ben Cleuch (a Graham at 721m) we enjoyed panoramic views down the long twisting length of the Forth, and further north to higher hills. Nowhere looked to be quite as clear and sunny as our hill though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now we had been following a well trodden path, but whilst a deep furrow led up to Ben Cleuch from the east, only one set of footprints could be seen heading off the summit to the west. As we were completing a traverse it was westward that we headed about to find out just how deep the undisturbed snow was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551763202"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent from Ben Cleuch" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5551763202_21850661ba_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite a deceptively long crossing on a broad ridge to reach the next hill of the day, Ben Buck. With the unceasing wind we didn't wait around on its summit too long, but now dropped down off Ben Buck into the wide area of boggy land separating us from the next hill, Blairdenon Hill. This was easily the most arduous part of the day with the deep snow hiding even deeper bogs, burns and holes. I think it's fair to say that most people went up to their knees or waist at least once, the snow pouring over boots whether or not gaiters were in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly turned towards the eastern end of Blairdenon Hill where a slight depression gave us sufficient shelter for a brief lunch stop. This was a good opportunity to dislodge a lot of the ice which had built up inside the rim of my boots! Luckily the chorizo and olive houmous rolls had sufficient spice to warm me back up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551786318"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wind Power" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5551786318_be877c3c4a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the lunch spot it wasn't far up to the eastern end of Blairdenon Hill where we paused at the small cairn to admire the view. Here a few folk decided to leave the high ground and take the vehicle track into Alva to wait for the bus there. We continued on though, finally reaching the true summit of Blairdenon Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551210115"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Ochils from Blairdenon Hill" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5055/5551210115_e917f50ba0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another fence line was now followed as we dropped steeply south off the hill. By this time the clouds had started reforming leading to some dramatic light over the lowlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551215461"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leaving Blairdenon Hill" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5028/5551215461_9dd47e43c3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Old Wharry Burn we contoured around the boggy land between Big Hunt Hill and Bengengie Hill, slowly losing height and with it much of the snow cover. By the time we came out below Loss Hill we were mainly walking on damp grass under gloomy skies. Ahead of us we now had our final target of the day Dumyat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551817566"&gt;&lt;img alt="The upper reaches of the Old Wharry Burn" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5172/5551817566_e45a01969e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dropped down towards the Lossburn Reservoir which involved a slightly convoluted route down a muddy bank, across a barbed wire fence near an old ruined farmhouse and then a slight pull back up to drier ground before we made it to the outflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551830014"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dumyat from the north" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5139/5551830014_a142731e3c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here a well constructed vehicle track led us up on to the northern slopes of Dumyat, a steep wee hill, clearly showing its volcanic origins, which sits just above Stirling. A well trodden path took us all the way up to the west end of the summit area where it was just a short walk along to the beacon tower and the trig point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5551859438"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trig point on Dumyat" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5024/5551859438_b4beb27036_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my second time up Dumyat and the views were definitely better this time, with shafts of sunlight scattered across the Forth floodplain, the Carse of Stirling and away over the Campsie Fells towards Glasgow. To the west and north a long march of mountains could be seen, the giants of the Southern Highlands, from Ben Lomond around to Ben Vorlich above Loch Earn. It showed the strange nature of the little Ochils, which stand prominently well south of the Highland Boundary Fault. It also offered a good viewpoint down the length of the Hillfoots, back to Tillicoultry where we had started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a final refreshment break, enjoying the views, it was off down the steep eastern side of the hill until the land flattened out and we dropped down into the village of Menstrie where the coach and the pub was waiting for us. For an 11 mile walk it had felt a lot longer and a lot tougher thanks to the deep snow, but the great views has more than made up for any slight numbness in the toes. I must remember the gaiters next time!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Clouds Lie Above Coire Nan Cat</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/03/the-clouds-lie-above-coire-nan-cat/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-06T23:13:17+00:00</published><updated>2011-03-06T23:13:17+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-03-06:/blog/2011/03/the-clouds-lie-above-coire-nan-cat/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 18.83km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it's fair to say that reliance on MWIS is both character building and somewhat exasperating. Saturday had been a splendid day in Aberdeen and I had enjoyed it with a wander around the town, a look round the brilliant &lt;a href="http://www.aagm.co.uk/Exhibitions/Current/Diane-Arbus-ARTIST-ROOMS.aspx"&gt;Diane Arbus portrait photography exhibition&lt;/a&gt; currently on at Aberdeen City Art Gallery, and coffee and carrot cake. The weather had been great; warm sunshine and hardly a breath of wind. For Sunday MWIS was confidently predicting 90% chance of cloud free Munros, only a little wind and reasonably mild temperatures. After initially thinking of heading to the Monadhliath, then the Laggan Hills, I finally decided to head south-west and make my first foray into the Lawers Range. I figured that the good forecast and a nice ridge walk would make an excellent combination.&lt;/p&gt;

I figured that the good forecast and a nice ridge walk would make an excellent combination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the weather set to get better into the afternoon I had a fairly lazy start, and didn't leave Aberdeen until 7am. The drive was quiet and with the exception of a tanker near Forfar and a tractor on the A9 I didn't have much traffic hassle. I was parked up at the Ben Lawers Hotel just after 9:30. Sadly, after blue skies in Aberdeen I had driven under low, gloomy cloud for much of the journey and it was no exception on the shores of Loch Tay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After booting up I was quickly away, munching on the final cookie from a bag of Tesco Oat &amp;amp; Raisin's, and made quick progress down the road to the turning onto the farm track. A bit of "ummming" and "aaaahing" over the map, a close encounter with some little, yappy dogs, and the strange sight of a large quantity of antlers in the back of a Freelander, soon had me on my way up the hillside on a good farm track. At the higher farm, signs led me around the outer buildings and yard until I passed through a gate and onto a much pleasanter narrow path that climbed up through the still woodland. Below and to my left the Lawers burn tumbled down a series of falls in its narrow ravine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5507189528"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5095/5507189528_2ec9d12a29_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing a couple of stiles I was out of the forest and passing by a cheerful blue sign that welcomed me to the Ben Lawers National Nature Reserve. Another sign further on asked me whether I was prepared for the mountains. I adjusted my hat, drew my zip up to my chin, and stepped out along the path. Initially I followed the main track which heads up to Coire Nan Cat. It passes through the strange bumps and stoneworks of a long-abandoned township. Just as the bridge came into sight crossing the Lawers burn I climbed steep grassy slopes to my right and began the long steady pull up to the summit of Sron Mhor, the lower southern shoulder of Meall Greigh. As I came out of the depression which holds the swift flowing burn I got a view up towards the high mountains surrounding Lochan nan Cat. Unfortunately the cloud was still low and obscured any sign of the summits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5503265933"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5292/5503265933_6817af0f3a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way up was steep and a little slippy on greasy grass but I enjoyed the views back down to Loch Tay and had the company of a small herd of sheep. I wandered briefly round the nose of Sron Mhor to get a look eastward down the loch and then headed upward where I picked up a clear track that disappeared up into the mist and the upper slopes of the first Munro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path offered a good surface and I made rapid progress up and over a couple of false summits before finally reaching the cairn in an otherwise featureless and misty world. I was glad to take a seat in the shelter of the cairn, only to realise my map wasn't with me. A short distance before the summit I had paused to adjust clothing and had popped the map into a crevice to stop it blowing away! 10 minutes later I was back at the summit cairn having retrieved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick cup of a tea and a cereal bar I now contemplated the way forward. Initially the descent takes you across a couple of steepish snow banks which were fun to descend. Then I once again picked up the clear baggers track which dropped down the wide ridge towards the bealach below Meall Garbh. As I dropped I came out of the clouds and had some dramatic views across to the encircling cloud-capped mountains, including catching a hopeful sign of sun on the slopes of the day's next mountain, Meall Garbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5506833256"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5253/5506833256_fc6cd93c61_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally reached the low point on the bealach where I got some views north into Glen Lyon and then had the uplifting experience of a dose of sunlight courtesy of a big break in the clouds. Sadly the effect was momentary, the clouds re-closed and I was thrown back into a sullen world. Behind me Meill Greigh briefly poked its misty summit out to have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5506258115"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5056/5506258115_6f1bd46a66_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spurred on by this brief spell of sunshine, I now enthusiastically followed the well-worn track, which largely follows closely the line of a fence, up the slopes of Meall Garbh. Soon enough I was back in the mist and plodded onwards, climbing what must be quite a fun slope if you can see where you are heading. A couple of snow sections added to the interest and then I was on the first of the parallel ridges. I knew I had to drop off it to reach the actual summit, but still went further along it to see what the terrain was like and perhaps trick the weather into giving me a view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't work so I crossed the boggy ground between the two ridges and then made the final climb up to the actual summit where I found the cairn and a sheltered spot for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5507051864"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5296/5507051864_371ec449df_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch yielded no improvement in the views, despite me taking some time over it. I also spent a good time pondering my next move. Continuing the ridge meant that the next summit would be An Stuc. Getting to An Stuc would mean climbing its impressive looking north face which doesn't exactly get rave reviews amongst hillwalkers. The map did indicate a steep but doable escape route down from the next bealach, so I continued on my way, dropping down the much more interesting southern ridge of Meall Garbh which has a few exciting moments on it. A decent path takes you all the way down to the bealach and then, barely visible through the mist was the vast, towering bulk of An Stuc. It was an impressive sight, dark ribbons of rock and snow that disappeared upwards into a tangle of crags and misty, half-glimpsed spires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm afraid to say that I didn't take any photos at all from this point, thinking that I was actually going to head down anyway and leave the ascent of An Stuc for another time. However, there was a clear track leading up the visible slopes and it didn't look so bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ventured forth, crossing a snowpatch and then climbing up the steep, scrabbly zig-zag path. I rapidly gained height and started to feel a bit more comfortable about the undertaking. Then I began to encounter ice and hard snow on the track. I stopped to put on crampons. I knew that they would be needed above and definitely didn't want to get myself into a situation where it was dangerous to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving upwards I was glad I had them on. Despite the changes in surface, from ice to rock to grass and back, they gripped beautifully and I continued on my way, following the track which was getting steeper and steeper. I then got to a section where the path appeared to branch. To the right a faint track led up to a very steep, vegetated, but snow-free gully. To the left there was a more distinctive set of tracks which then led out onto a very steep snow-covered slope. A set of footprints could be seen angling up it on a rising traverse but it was difficult to see how far they went in the mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I weighed up the pros and cons and decided that the snow slope was the way to go. I re-tightened every possible strap, looped my axe leash around my wrist and began the ascent. It was exhilarating. Every step I crunched the crampons hard into the snow, buried the ice axe, secured my grip and then made another step forward. It seemed to take forever with a look down revealing a spiralling white descent into absolute void. After losing sight of the point at which I had left the track, I finally looked up and out of the whiteness had formed dark shapes; rocks, grass and the continuation of the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on firm ground I breathed a huge sigh of relief. I was now only a short distance below the summit and the angle immediately eased off. I followed the track which led to a final snowfield which I climbed to emerge triumphant onto the summit ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cairn was deserted so I was able to make myself at home, stretching out to enjoy the non-views and taking off my crampons and stowing away the ice axe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5506463971"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5056/5506463971_f3f07147b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided a second lunch was called for so dropped slightly off the summit to get out of the bitingly cold wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this revitalisation I set off, now feeling much happier and ready to head back down. From here it is easily possible to continue on to Ben Lawers but with the continued lack of view I didn't really see the point in continuing just for the sake of it. I followed the excellent track off An Stuc which again dropped me out of the mist and gave some great views down to Lochan nan Cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5506472099"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5506472099_f1f00e9cd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bealach I found a faint track that ran down a steep shoulder. It kept above the steep, snowy main ascent gully and then dropped me onto the snow further down where the gradient was less severe. It was then a case of picking my way down the steep slopes, snowy at first to the top of a set of crags, but then giving way to grass as I picked my way through. Eventually I got myself onto a nice grass rake that took me almost down to the waterside of Lochan nan Cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5507079816"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5131/5507079816_c442024afa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area around the loch was boggy but there were patches of firm ground here and there and something of a track. After a pause to breathe in the quiet surroundings (as well as a brief wander to scope out some wild camp spots) I took to the track, sticking close by the shore of the loch until I reached the far end. Here a gravel beach was a fine spot for a final spot of tea with views back across the still frozen waters to the feet of the mountains I'd been up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past the smaller southern section of the loch I continued to follow the track which got better as it started to drop downhill besides the Lawers Burn. Soon I reached the small dam and picked up the broad vehicle track. A helpful cairn marks the point a couple of hundred metres left where you turn off the main track to drop down by the burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5507149930"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5213/5507149930_1bc7cd75ef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a delightful track on good springy turf that keeps you high above the impressive ravine with the view starting to open out over Loch Tay. Eventually I caught sight of the bridge and followed a good zig-zag track to descend to the crossing point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5507168462"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5507168462_18c5a515a7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once across I was soon reunited with my outward track which gave an easy route back down to the road and so to the Ben Lawers Hotel. You can use their car park on the understanding that you make a purchase at the hotel. As it was getting on for tea time I decided to stop for a hearty helping of steak &amp;amp; ale pie and a cup of tea. It set me up nicely for the long drive back to Aberdeen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was disappointing not to get the views on what is supposed to be a fine round but I felt a good sense of achievement at having climbed An Stuc and three new Munros is a good way to start the month!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Munros North of Glen Lyon</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/05/munros-north-of-glen-lyon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-24T20:44:11+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-24T20:44:11+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-05-24:/blog/2009/05/munros-north-of-glen-lyon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 24th May 2009&lt;br&gt;

The quiet roads were a joy and in no time at all I was off the A90 and winding my way through the backroads of first Angus and then Perthshire. A dash up a deserted A9 got me to Aberfeldy and then it was a matter of following the Glen Lyon/Bridge of Balgie signs until, having negotiated my way down the narrowest of single lane roads, I found myself at the car park below the telephone box in Invervar just a few minutes before 8:30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kitted up and with slightly reckless shortsleeves I crossed the road, went through the gate and was soon heading up a track through the woods. Somewhere to my left there was the roar of the burn tumbling down and occasionally I glimpsed flecks of white water through the lush greenery that was basking in the early sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562826219"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue skies over Meall Garbh" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3324/3562826219_000b589c57_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the woods onto more open hillside I continued up a well defined track. Ahead of me was the shoulder of the dayâ€™s second hill, Meall Garbh. White sheep dotted the hillside and as I climbed Glen Lyon opened up behind me. South, over the treetops could be seen the fastness of the Lawers range rising up until its peaks were lost in a cap of ominous grey cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562833105"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Sgorr from the slopes of Carn Gorm" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3380/3562833105_eeca64b520_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sunshine I was happy, crossing the rickety metal bridge at 660495 before continuing up the track on the left side of the burn. At a point just after the trees the main turned to climb onto the open moorland and the long ridge of Carn Gorm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3563650990"&gt;&lt;img alt="View across to Ben Lawers range" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3355/3563650990_a7e0dcd774_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was enjoying the walk by the water though and kept heading alongside it before finally climbing steep, boggy ground to reach the main track half way up the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562841817"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Lawers" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3660/3562841817_4a830a60a3_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of me Carn Gorm showed a good profile, particular with the top of An Sgurr to its right. The track narrowed and zig-zagged its way up the face, the views on to the Lawers range getting better and better at each turn. An Stuc was just out of cloud whilst Lawers itself was still attracting a covering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562843539"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lyon from Carn Gorm" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3598/3562843539_a56eaab74a_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A level section was crossed and then the final pull up was completed with the summit being reached just an hour after setting off from the car. Up here the wind was strong and gusty and carried a feeling of snow. I stopped by the ruined trig points to admire the extensive view. Loch Rannoch was now revealed and beyond Lawers I could see Ben More and Stob Binnein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562847545"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn Gorm (1020m)" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3562847545_a80c28e42a_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sheltered side of the cairn I donned layers including hat and gloves as the temperature had dropped noticeably with the climb. From now on Iâ€™d be above 800m for the rest of the day until dropping down from the final summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3562888165"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_0840.CR2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3017/3562888165_24f86a0941_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good path led off the top down the north ridge which had pleasing views back down the ascent route and a fine view of Loch Rannoch. Instead of staying on the main track I went up the top of An Sgurr before dropping down to the col below the next Munro, Meall Garbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3563711246"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_0846.CR2" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2482/3563711246_2135413585_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track climbed steeply beside a line of metal fence posts until the large cairn, topped by numerous posts, on a gentle domed summit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind was biting but had definitely helped to break the cloud up meaning the sun was back out again. From the 968 summit I headed across to the 963 top and then returned to the fence line to drop down a bouldery summit to the next col.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here and as I climbed up to Meall a' Bharr there were excellent views onto the scree slopes of Schiehallion which lay just to the northeast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardly any height is lost on this next section of plateau which runs around to the stony rim of Coire Chearcaill and brings you up close to the crag which forms a great southern facing prow to Carn Mairg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited the summit and then dropped the sack behind the tor to have a scramble across it to get the views over to Ben Lawers and the final Munro of the day, Meall na Aighean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3563017679"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn Mairg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3560/3563017679_45c0a469ab_z.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the bag it was around 11:30 and having been walking for 3 hours now I decided it was high time for some food. After this I dropped steeply down close to the craps on the southern side of Carn Mairg. There was a track but this was a lot steeper than the recommended route down the east ridge. In no time I was heading across the peaty Bealach where I met the first walkers of the day. They had descended Meall na Aighean. I followed their steps up, branching left to reach the main summit just on 12pm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sat on the jumbled summit, admiring views to Ben Lawers and the Tyndrum hills I felt quite satisfied at having got four Munros in before midday. Whilst there hadn't been much re-ascent, it had been much colder than expected. It had been good to enjoy the solitude of these hills as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped off the summit and visited the 974 top before joining the splendid main track which drops off the west ridge heading straight for Invervar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused several times on the way down to enjoy the views but before too long I was rejoining the outward track and heading back through the forest to the now very much more crowded car park!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>The Sidlaws</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/01/the-sidlaws/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-18T23:51:34+00:00</published><updated>2009-01-18T23:51:34+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-01-18:/blog/2009/01/the-sidlaws/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 9.7 miles&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3210390295"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing up Iron Hill" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3308/3210390295_e7232d12ac_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might have been a new part of the world for the Stockets but the fresh air got us moving quickly up the steep slopes of Iron Hill away from the road. We observed the bus driver taking a quick self-portrait – evidently even he thought the surroundings were nice. After Liz barrel rolled through a fence we had a much more sedate climb up to our first summit where a flurry of snow from dark clouds hinted at a later change in the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3211270408"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking towards Craigow Hill" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3263/3211270408_c0a895c2fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
?For now though we seemed to be in the one clear patch for miles around. From horizon to horizon we were surrounded by shifting clouds and falling rain but after the snow abated we enjoyed walking in beautiful sunshine and wonderful views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3211284864"&gt;&lt;img alt="Winter Sun over the Fields of Dundee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3425/3211284864_7f6f5c2798_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Iron Hill we could have bagged Gallow Hill but a navigation error kept us on the distinct track through the heather towards the TV tower on the southern slopes of this eastern end of the Sidlaws. As we crested the ridge here we were treated to a view of the lower Tay valley with the Firth of Tay a glistening silver band beyond the city of Dundee. Everything glowed in the low winter sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk along the ridge to the road up to the weather station at Craigston hill was enjoyable and after a short tarmac’d section we reached the trig point and our high point for the day at 535m. Elevenses were had whilst we waited for the Dundee crew, including Sidlaw expert Alick, to join us. In the distance we could see the Folly on the day’s final hill. It looked a good distance and was also basking in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3211324310"&gt;&lt;img alt="Examining the Trig Point, Craigow Hill" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3211324310_2e1e81fac4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Craigston we skirted around more radio paraphernalia then dropped down onto a good path winding its way up from Dundee which led us up to a look out on Balluderon hill. It offered fabulous panoramas and in fact under sombre clouds the base of some of the closer Cairngorms could be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3210524079"&gt;&lt;img alt="Craigow Hill in the distance" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3483/3210524079_579f7b477a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we zig-zagged our way amongst the heather-clad hills until we reached the remains of the hill fort on Auchterhouse Hill. There was a stiff breeze as we enjoyed views into Fife and all down the Tay and into the North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3210558097"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shadows and Light" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3255/3210558097_449747b49d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lea side of the hill several Stockets decided to break for lunch whilst others carried on across the somewhat boggy ground en route to Scotston Hill. In a small dell we paused for our lunch, remarking on the cloud that had crept in on the now stiffened south-westerly breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to reach Scotston Hill were thwarted by an impressive fence so we skirted the contours back up to the main path. This led us above a small quarry and then onto a landrover track which wove its way around Henderston Hill. Bob appointed himself our forest guide and we wound our way through firebreaks and along hidden paths until we emerged somewhat away from our target of Kinpurnie Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3211415356"&gt;&lt;img alt="Firth of Tay" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3500/3211415356_a628359529_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing some more open land brought us up on to the final hill of the day where the impressive stone tower of earlier in the day turned out to be a somewhat disappointing shell with a propensity for funnelling the wind. The imposing clouds cut off the views from the panorama and it wasn’t long before we sought the shelter of the valley and the village of Newtyle only a mile or so below us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3211454574"&gt;&lt;img alt="Defensive" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/3211454574_98094b8a22_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent was a treacherous combination of slick grass and churned up mud which only became worse as we slithered our way through the woods alongside a chattering burn. It was well marked and thankfully had adequate hand railings which became even more important as a heavy rain started to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last half mile or so along the road were desperately unpleasant with thick rain driven into us by a strong wind. Nevertheless the comparative shelter of the bus was obtained, dry waterproofs were donned and our day was rounded off by a pint in the pub and the knowledge of an unlikely triumph at Pitodrie.&lt;/p&gt;
