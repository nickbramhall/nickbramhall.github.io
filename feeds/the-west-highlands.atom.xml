&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A loop around the steep-sided Corbett of Stob a' Choin from Inverlochlarig with beautiful views on a clear April day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 06 April 2025&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 11.69km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 920m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 6.2hrs&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Stob a' Choin (Corbett) &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Cold start with early mist clearing from the hills to leave a fine, sunny day with a cold east wind&lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/542"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/articles/cly507egz2zo"&gt;Omega Block&lt;/a&gt; continuing to dominate the weather patterns I was keen to get out into the hills for the first time in a few weeks. After a somewhat lacklustre late winter, April came good and the country basked in seemingly endless sunny skies. There was an easterly wind keeping temperatures in check, but as the weekend approached even that was forecast to drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed out early on Sunday morning, driving through a sleepy Bridge of Allan, Doune and Callendar before passing by Loch Lubnaig where tendrils of mist were just lifting off the water. The external temperature slowly dropped as I got further into the hills, until the ice warning came on just as a gritter passed me coming in the opposite direction. The sunshine was beautiful with the highest mountains holding onto a cap of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned onto the minor road to Balqhuidder and Loch Voil which seemed quieter now that the camping restrictions have been implemented. I was last down here in May 2010 to &lt;a href="https://invertedworld.co.uk/hills/trip/386"&gt;climb the Falloch Munros&lt;/a&gt; on a similarly sunny spring day. Thankfully there was little early track and I made slow but steady progress down to the large parking area just short of Inverlochlarig. Arriving at 8:30 I was surprised to find an already quite busy car park with one group heading off and another guy getting booted up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was soon sorted and after quickly checking the map headed along the road to Inverlochlarig farm where helpful signposts and open gates guide you through the farmyard without much fuss. The morning air was cool with the sun only now just peeking above the hills to the east. It made for very pleasant walking conditions and after leaving the last of the trees behind, I came out into the open glen with the River Larig running cheerfully alongside the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54457653822/in/album-72177720325153342" title="The Larig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54457653822_764636f6ab_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="The Larig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My target for the day, the Corbett of Stob a' Choin, dominates the southern side of the Larig. Its steep and imposing looking north ridge rises steeply from the river right to the summit in what appears to be a single line. In fact there are some steep and difficult crags about a third of the way up so the recommended route is to traverse the northeastern flanks to gain the ridge above these difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458811258/in/album-72177720325153342" title="River Larig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458811258_1d4fd43527_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="River Larig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the river by the handy footbridge and then followed the line of an old stone wall over boggy ground to a point where I could start to rise up into the steep coire below the Bealach Coire an Laoigh. Above me a small herd of deer ran off, seeking steeper ground to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steep slopes meant I gained height quickly and soon I was looking back down to the sunlit River Larig and the Falloch hills to the north which still retained their caps of cloud. A guy had followed me to the bridge but I could see that he was now following the loop in the opposite direction, climbing up steep slopes to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458562746/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chroin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458562746_280833b83f_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chroin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing a fence and picking my way over the allt coming down through a narrow, dark ravine, I headed up into a side coire below the north ridge. The day was warming up nicely and I as I passed from shade back to sunlight I paused here on a boulder to sit and have a snack and drink from the flask. There were a few bird calls but otherwise it was peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458751699/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Ravine on Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458751699_f626eef705_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ravine on Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458564786/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Inverlochlarig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458564786_18d8870476_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Inverlochlarig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headwall of the coire was incredibly steep but grassy and I carefully made my way up, eventually emerging on a broad shoulder of the north ridge. I was a bit unsure if I had completely avoided the crags but now could see the ridge rising grassy above me with no further difficulties besides the unrelenting steepness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458823548/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="North ridge of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458823548_c7caca4a91_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="North ridge of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views from here were great and after pausing to take them in I headed up the steep slopes. There wasn't any evidence of a path so it was just a case of picking the best route and making slow but steady progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458566601/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Loch Voil from the north ridge of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458566601_dfb8e7082b_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Loch Voil from the north ridge of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the steepness relented and I popped out on the north top of Stob a' Choin. It had taken a good couple of hours to get here but the effort was worth it for this must be one of the finest viewpoints in this part of the Highlands. As I'd climbed the lingering cloud had finally blown through and now it was clear with views across the ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458758774/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="North summit of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458758774_df4a8255c2_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="North summit of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paused here to take a well earned break. On the top there was a fairly brisk and cold east wind, so I sought some shelter just below the summit where in the sun it felt very pleasant. Cloud was lifting off most of the surrounding mountaintops including the nearby Crianlarich Munros as well as the Trossachs, Ben Lomond and the more distant Arrochar Alps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458829993/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Ben Lomond"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458829993_1c1da04ea7_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ben Lomond"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then just a fairly short walk down and out of a hollow and back up to reach the true summit of Stob a' Choin. Here there was a narrow fin of rock with a small cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458836138/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Pool on Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458836138_63df23e066_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Pool on Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458839633/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Summit of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458839633_db472adbef_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Summit of Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I found some shelter on the southwest side of the summit and paused here for an early lunch break. The other hillwalker now appeared on the east ridge and slowly made his way to the summit of the Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458943400/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Ben Ledi and Hillwalker"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458943400_97da6344f8_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ben Ledi and Hillwalker"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this vantage point I could see parts of Loch Katrine, its silvered surface reflecting the bright sun. To the east I could see the very end of Loch Voil and it was evident that there was more cloud over to the east, a darker bank of haze on the far horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54457739207/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Loch Katrine"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54457739207_d8c8e77ebd_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Loch Katrine"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458770079/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Loch Voil"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458770079_6edfb0be15_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Loch Voil"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steep characteristic of Stob a' Choin proved to be the case on this side also as I now descended southeast to loop around onto the east ridge, Craig nan Saighhead. The terrain between here and there was quite complex but an old fence line made it fairly easy to drop steeply down into the Bealach Coire an Laoigh. Near the bottom of this slope I said hello to the other hillwalker as he climbed steeply up to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458844528/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Bealach Coire an Laoigh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458844528_b46f77221c_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Bealach Coire an Laoigh"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the bottom of the gulley it was a steep climb back up the far side. This was a slightly shorter though and soon I was on the rolling ridge that lead south and east in the direction of Loch Katrine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458845083/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Cruach Ardrain and Stob Binnein"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458845083_4db5de84d7_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Cruach Ardrain and Stob Binnein"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458774854/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Bealach Coire an Laoigh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458774854_b5734ed28b_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Bealach Coire an Laoigh"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I followed the high ground over a series of lumpy tops I got good views back to the summit of Stob a' Choin where the hillwalker was enjoying the views and solitude. This area gave a better angle onto the end of Loch Katrine, with Loch Arklet sitting below the broad outline of Ben Lomond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458599176/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458599176_a770d791ec_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reached the southern end of the ridge I crossed another gulley and emerged just south of Point 836 where I paused for a second lunch in the sunshine. The views to the south across Loch Katrine and the Trossachs were spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458958260/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin and Meall Reamhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458958260_81928d95e3_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin and Meall Reamhar"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54457759892/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Ben Lomond and Loch Katrine"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54457759892_77cd92df8a_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Ben Lomond and Loch Katrine"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched a couple of boats ply the waters of the loch before packing up and turning northward to now descend back towards the River Larig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54457763567/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Creag nan Saighead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54457763567_2f12e29714_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Creag nan Saighead"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again I was following a line of fenceposts, and a faint track emerged as I joined back on the main loop to the Corbett. This made the going a bit easier for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458611656/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Pool on Creag nan Saighead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458611656_9220b88878_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Pool on Creag nan Saighead"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the terrain still offered some steep sections, which required careful descent on some steep and slippery grass. It was less unrelenting than the ascent, but still provided some moments where caution was necassary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458975440/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458975440_0b18e7d0f1_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got further north I started to get views onto the steep slopes running up to Stob a' Choin. Some sections I had walked up earlier looked impossibly steep: a trick of the perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458876338/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Towards Inverlochlarig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458876338_53b2a43539_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Towards Inverlochlarig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower down the ridge broaded out but was still steep in places. I aimed for the top of the forestry and enjoyed the views over Inverlochlarig and towards Loch Voil. There was no hint now of the earlier cloud in gloriously blue skies. Looking back gave me a new perspective on the jumbled collection of summits that make up the Stob a' Choin round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458877628/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458877628_64424a9732_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came down to a meeting of various fences, marking the spot at which I would leave the ridge and drop back down steep and wet slopes to the River Larig. This slope hadn't looked too bad earlier but proved to once again be fairly steep. I angled towards the footbridge, looking forward to a sit by the river in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458623046/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="River Larig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458623046_e74d68eb95_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="River Larig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458809054/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458809054_5efd8b6ef2_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choin"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54457781792/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="River Larig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54457781792_ea5fe3f119_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="River Larig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once down at the river I crossed the footbridge and then found a nice boulder sitting mid-stream to sit on and enjoy the last of my food in the hot sunshine with my feet soaking in the cold mountains waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/54458989820/in/album-72177720325153342/" title="River Larig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/54458989820_ed54fb8588_h.jpg" width="100%" alt="River Larig"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this it was a simple case of following the track abck to the car, passing back through the farm and saying hello to various groups of hillwalkers and people out walking their dogs. Despite the date it felt like a summer's afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday 26th September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to complete my Munros in the area between Etive and Rannoch Moor I’d always planned to do the &lt;em&gt;Clachlet Traverse&lt;/em&gt; of the Black Mount hills. Traditionally a route that ran between the Inveroran Hotel and Kingshouse Hotel taking in the four Munro summits of Stob a’ Choire Odhair, Stob Ghabhar, Creise and Meall a’ Bhuiridh, it is now more typically done between the respective car parks at Victoria Bridge and the Glencoe Ski Centre! Often done in a single day as a through walk, I wanted to loop back along the West Highland Way to avoid any public transport shenanigans and thought the route would suit a wild camp, breaking up the walk with an overnight stop somewhere around the summit of Creise, possibly even dropping onto the Corbett Being Mhic Chosgaig to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Previous trips in the same area&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/blog/2010/02/stob-a-choire-odhair-and-stob-ghabhar/"&gt;Stob a' Choire Odhair and Stob Ghabhar - February 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One weekend last summer I’d packed my bag for this route but had been put off by forecast galeforce winds. This time the weather forecast was looking too good to miss and so I rolled away from home at 6:15 on a Saturday morning and headed for Victoria Bridge near the Bridge of Orchy. Apart from a couple of slow campervans it wasn’t too bad a drive. The large parking area was almost full (of campervans) but I managed to squeeze the car in besides a massive RV, trying my best not to be too noisy as I did a final gear sort and scoffed down a couple of croissants with some coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411096132/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The Abhainn Shira"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411096132_54de3e1e41_b.jpg" alt="The Abhainn Shira"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path alongside the Abhainn Shira was as delightful as always and I made quick progress along to the Clashgour Hut where a side path leads up besides the tumbling Allt Toaig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410252363/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The Clashgour Hut"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410252363_10e4b1822a_b.jpg" alt="The Clashgour Hut"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410265528/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar from the path up Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410265528_03f95f9783_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar from the path up Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were strong hints of autumnal colours in the trees and bracken. Although calm down in the glen, as I steadily gained height a strong northerly wind made its presence felt - cold and fresh! The sunshine made for perfect walking temperatures and I made good progress upwards with Stob Ghabhar and Stob a’ Choire Odhair drawing closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411134552/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Track into Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411134552_99726a2cb5_b.jpg" alt="Track into Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of evidence of heavy summer rains as I crossed the scoured channel of the Allt Caolain Duibh before taking the side track that leads up to the south ridge of Stob a’ Choire Odhair. This climbs up through a deep and rough channel lower down before becoming better constructed higher up. The views quickly opened out behind me towards the Ben Cruachan range. Off to the left a passing shower darkened the skies but produced a brief rainbow over Stob Ghabhar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411027496/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rainbow in Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411027496_60d38f2c72_b.jpg" alt="Rainbow in Coire Toaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411202772/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Across the Abhainn Shira"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411202772_609259bdd4_b.jpg" alt="Across the Abhainn Shira"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain didn’t amount to much and as I emerged onto the broader upper slopes the sun was back out. As the views over to Stob Ghabhar developed behind me I came up to the summit cairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411219912/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411219912_fd5128dfbb_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of walkers who had departed the car park as I arrived were just leaving, so I had the top of this first Munro to myself. Here the chill northerly wind made its presence felt and after taking a couple of photos at the cairn I found a slightly more sheltered spot to sit and enjoy the views out over the Rannoch Moor. The views over the burnished surface of Loch Tulla to the wall of Rannoch and away across the southern Highlands were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411325511/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rannoch Moor from Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411325511_645a8aa410_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor from Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the north there was a stubborn band of cloud sitting around the summits of the northern Black Mount hills of Clach Leathad and Meall a' Bhuiridh. The cloud was varying in height though and Bidein nam Bian above Glencoe was completely cloud free. Out of the wind I had a short snack break&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410595138/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Clach Leathad and Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410595138_88e3b2bd0d_b.jpg" alt="Clach Leathad and Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411347716/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Across Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411347716_d6e2739d12_b.jpg" alt="Across Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed off the summit, catching a glimpse of the two in front of me who were now heading for Stob Ghabhar. The lochan in Coirean Lochain was briefly visible as I followed the fairly clear path down the west ridge of the mountain with Ben Cruachan visible in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411362741/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411362741_7a5d21d1ae_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410672783/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ben Cruachan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410672783_915199fa0c_b.jpg" alt="Ben Cruachan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud had lifted off the Black Mount hills and from the west ridge there were excellent views across the River Ba. Sunshine was picking out the rocks and buttresses of Stob Ghabhar and it felt very pleasant as I dropped out of the worst of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410685678/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Across the River Ba"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410685678_2024b290c5_b.jpg" alt="Across the River Ba"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50410697503/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The ridge to Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50410697503_0abe74fb69_b.jpg" alt="The ridge to Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path follows the high ground around the head of Coire Toaig, crossing various lumps and outcroppings before gently rising up to the ridge that leads up towards the Aonach Eagach ridge (not quite as fearsome as its near neighbour in Glencoe). Behind me Stob a' Choire Odhair receded into the distance, strong autumn colours along the ridge picked out by the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411585691/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411585691_49d6098439_b.jpg" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good path follows the lower ridge with views down to Coirein Lochain and up to the rugged summit of Stob Ghabhar. Once the boulders are met the path becomes more vague and aware of the two people somewhere above me I picked out my own line upwards. The ascent is stiff but soon over and it was a pleasure to emerge on the grassy slopes just short of where the ridge narrows to the Aonach Eagach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412007282/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Climbing Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412007282_0f43d2e2d8_b.jpg" alt="Climbing Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411903726/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411903726_0098c354b5_b.jpg" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spot offered a nice view down the winding line of the Abhain Shira to Loch Tulla with the Bridge of Orchy hills beyond. This also brought me back into the wind and made me a little trepidatious about the ridge ahead. Whilst not knife-edge narrow, it also isn't a place for putting a foot in the wrong place or being knocked unsteady by a gusting wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412103397/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar and Bidein"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412103397_fd4d896f0c_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar and Bidein"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a gentle grassy pull up to the point where the ridge proper started. I was soon there, and saw that the two folk in front of me were already well along the ridge and didn't seem to be having any difficulty with the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412125272/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412125272_c05501249c_b.jpg" alt="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a delightful stretch of ridge walking. You could do most of it with hands in pockets, although for the most part I stuck to the crest, where there were a couple of moments where hands went onto rock to steady myself. It is airy and the views all around were excellent. It is also sadly short-lived and I soon found myself approaching the cairn that marks where the normal route comes up from the glen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412342797/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="On the Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412342797_26b25fc5e4_b.jpg" alt="On the Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411498608/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411498608_2648466e97_b.jpg" alt="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50411550833/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Coirein Lochain and the Black Mount"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50411550833_8f09af1043_b.jpg" alt="Coirein Lochain and the Black Mount"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there were expansive views out west towards Ben Cruachan and Ben Starav. Nearer at hand the final slope to the summit of Stob Ghabhar beckoned. Looking back over the line of the Aonach Eagach I could see the hazy peaks of the southern Highlands stretching out beyond the Rannoch Wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412278811/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412278811_8c7c4e1873_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412333331/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Looking along the Aonach Eagach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412333331_4bfb59a64d_b.jpg" alt="Looking along the Aonach Eagach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412770992/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ben Cruachan and Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412770992_5ce06bd3d6_b.jpg" alt="Ben Cruachan and Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing my attention away from the views I headed up the final slope to the summit, passing the two walkers as they headed back down off the top. This meant that once again I arrived to an empty summit with panoramic views in all directions. Considering it was around midday on a sunny Saturday in September I was genuinely surprised to find it so quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50412831382/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50412831382_9727719960_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chill wind was still around so after a few photos I dropped slightly off the summit and found a comfy spot to sit down for lunch. The views were grand and even the clouds that had stubbornly hung around Ben Nevis were now lifting. One of the most impressive views is over the Coirein Lochain and out past Stob a' Choire Odhair to Rannoch Moor beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50413774491/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Coirein Lochain and Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50413774491_3e705e387b_b.jpg" alt="Coirein Lochain and Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50413128743/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50413128743_f3d70c88d0_b.jpg" alt="Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50413999407/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ben Nevis and the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50413999407_81650f880f_b.jpg" alt="Ben Nevis and the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few folk had started arriving as I finished off my lunch so it was good to get packed up and way, dropping northwest of the summit which quickly took me away from people once again. The angled summit slopes quickly give way to a rolling grassy plateau that curves around Coire Lochain. Strangely there was almost no wind here and in the sunshine it felt like strolling along on a summer's day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50413877036/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Looking down Coire a&amp;#x27; Chaolain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50413877036_c184c8e5e4_b.jpg" alt="Looking down Coire a&amp;#x27; Chaolain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50414049387/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Towards the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50414049387_3a08750752_b.jpg" alt="Towards the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak upon peak stretched out in front of me with the route of the Clachlet Traverse now obvious as it wound its way round to Clach Leathad. I briefly detoured away from the route to a rocky point overlooking the far side of Coirein Lochain. There were now figures strung out along the length of the Aonach Eagach. Down below the blue-green waters of the lochan in Coirein Lochain were ruffled by the strong winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50413906846/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Coirein Lochain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50413906846_a97f22a2d3_b.jpg" alt="Coirein Lochain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50414090242/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Coirein Lochain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50414090242_c9e44f7f28_b.jpg" alt="Coirein Lochain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now rejoined my intended route, dropping down onto the undulating ridge of Aonach Mor, leading roughly north away from Stob Ghabhar. There are deep coires on either side and as I picked my way over the lumps and bumps I caught sight of the small herd of goats that are often found around Stob Ghabhar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50416138137/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The goats of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50416138137_5a73bf2966_b.jpg" alt="The goats of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I headed along the ridge the hills of Glen Etive and Glencoe grew a little closer. To the east the buttressed slopes of Stob Ghabhar and Stob a' Choire Odhair looked very impressive, their northern slopes deep in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50415303718/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair and neighbours"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50415303718_fa96bb4603_b.jpg" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27; Choire Odhair and neighbours"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part way along the Aonach More a loosely defined ridge drops eastward down to
the Bealach Fuar-chathaid which provides the link onto Clach Leathad and the northern part of the Black Mount. As I looked over the bealach I could see four tiny figures leave the summit of Clach Leathad and head in my direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50416011966/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="The Bealach Fuar-chathaid"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50416011966_ffe7e49e8a_b.jpg" alt="The Bealach Fuar-chathaid"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50416046506/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Looking back to Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50416046506_6a47c32366_b.jpg" alt="Looking back to Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridge was a little steeper than it first appeared, especially in the lower section where it was either a steep grassy gully or a more rocky series of drops. I ended up between the two and was glad to reach the bealach itself. This has a rocky dome in the middle which I skirted around to the north, pausing briefly for an afternoon snack break with views along to Glen Etive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50416225192/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50416225192_472004b56c_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417269252/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417269252_01d81b6509_b.jpg" alt="Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a gap in the hills the dark profile of Buchaille Etive Mor was visible with the Crowberry Tower a distinct feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417247887/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Crowberry Tower on the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417247887_6197c78fb7_b.jpg" alt="Crowberry Tower on the Buchaille"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once across the bealach the equally steep slope up Clach Leathad had to be tackled. There are a number of crags on this hillside but a good look upwards confirmed a line of weakness. There was a faint path lower down but it was quickly lost to a wet and rocky hillside. I just picked the best line up and made reasonable progress. I met the two pairs of walkers coming down and had a good chat about the superb weather conditions and our respective plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417305862/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ascent of Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417305862_8837f4b26b_b.jpg" alt="Ascent of Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep slope eventually relented and I emerged onto the broad ridge which runs northwest up to the bouldery summit slopes. The quality of light made the day feel like it was far advanced, though in reality it was still mid-afternoon. I enjoyed the views north towards Glencoe and the nearby slopes of Creise. Stob Ghabhar now looked a long way off to the southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417269551/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417269551_c5148dc205_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50416488428/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar and Ben Cruachan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50416488428_dfda71f669_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar and Ben Cruachan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a false summit and then a further sweep of boulders and windblown grass to cross before I finally reached the large cairn and wind shelter on the summit of Clach Leathad. Suddenly I was looking out over the yawning coire to monolithic Meall a' Bhuiridh beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417762032/in/photostream/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh from Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417762032_f21c0e2b35_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh from Clach Leathad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there was a grand view along the sweeping ridge leading to Creise, the actual Munro summit, still some way off. I could also see down to the Kingshouse Hotel far below, and follow the line of the A82, busy with traffic, out over Rannoch Moor. Surprisingly I once again had a summit to myself so I sat down for a snack break in the shelter of the substantial cairn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The afternoon vistas were grand and I was feeling optimistic about a summit camp, despite the wind. Looking out over the southern slopes of Creise it looked like there might be a suitable area at the head of the ridge that led down to the Corbett of Beinn Mhic Chosgaig. As I was contemplating the views there was suddenly music in the air and a man with a speaker (and a dog) came up to the summit. I had to regretfully inform him that this wasn't the Munro summit (it's just a metre short of Creise!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417075288/in/photostream/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh and Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417075288_f623f6e307_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh and Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once again shouldered my bag and headed off now almost due north, following a clear trail that followed the edge of the cliffs with grand views across the coire containing Loch an Easain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417986307/in/photostream/" title="Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417986307_9c9acfeed2_b.jpg" alt="Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417153448/in/photostream/" title="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417153448_598cb5f648_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417869476/in/photostream/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417869476_dafd29d09e_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the midpoint of the ridge, a subsidiary ridge drops down to the east leading straight to Meall a' Bhuiridh and my eventual onward route. Creise now stood close by and finally it got a bit busier with a few groups making their way off the summit. As the angle changes Meall a' Chuiridh appeared more pyramid-like, whilst off to the west the Glen Etive peaks were fading slightly into the warm haze that had developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417880941/in/photostream/" title="Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417880941_ca9505c9a3_b.jpg" alt="Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short order I was stood at the summit cairn of Creise, my third Munro of the day. It was about 3:30pm and so had taken me about 7 hours to get here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417923261/in/photostream/" title="Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417923261_e634d18870_b.jpg" alt="Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that I was very likely going to be back here, possibly the next morning, I soon got out of the wind and dropped down to find a comfortable spot to sit and enjoy the views. There were a couple of people near the cairn but it seemed that in general most people were now heading back down. From this vantage point the long ridgeback of Buchaille Etive Mor and the deep trench of Glen Etive were dominant features and the lengthening shadows picked out their features beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417251533/in/photostream/" title="Glen Etive from Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417251533_df0e1a224c_b.jpg" alt="Glen Etive from Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped down off the summit to get a clear view of the Buchaille with Ben Nevis beyond it. The light was hazy and magical. Stob Ghabhar was a distant bump at the centre of radiating ridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417299143/in/photostream/" title="Buchaille Etive Mor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417299143_fb919e3ecb_b.jpg" alt="Buchaille Etive Mor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417304398/in/photostream/" title="Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417304398_bd7f1758e6_b.jpg" alt="Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After half an hour of lazying in the sun and enjoying the views it was time to make a decision. I was fairly committed to the idea of heading to the Corbett with the notion that I would likely find a suitable camping spot on the way, and if not, that the Corbett summit offered what looked to be flattish ground with potential water sources nearby. Hunkered down behind Creise it would hopefully be sheltered from the worst of the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418236427/in/photostream/" title="The Buchaille and Lochaber"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418236427_84478bd9f8_b.jpg" alt="The Buchaille and Lochaber"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After packing up and heading back to the summit I noticed there was another cairn just a little further north which might offer good views onto the Buchaille, so I headed there first. This was when, just a few steps below the summit, I came upon an absolutely perfect area for camping - a small balcony just off the summit with flat, springy turf and sheltered from the wind coming in from the northeast. Even though I still had 3 hours of daylight I quickly decided this was where I would be stopping for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417380723/in/photostream/" title="Towards the Easains and Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417380723_7aa3bb421b_b.jpg" alt="Towards the Easains and Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417394928/in/photostream/" title="Buchaille Etive Mor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417394928_33c506c176_b.jpg" alt="Buchaille Etive Mor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views from the north top were excellent and after enjoying them I dropped down to my camping area and soon found the perfect spot for the tent with a grand view over Glen Etive and the Buchaille. I soon had the tent up and was able to enjoy a very relaxed afternoon. I did briefly contemplate heading over to the Corbett, or even dropping down and bagging the very northern top of Creise, but once I was relaxed in the sunshine these ideas quickly dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418290587/in/photostream/" title="Camped on Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418290587_583d1ca42e_b.jpg" alt="Camped on Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the next few hours wandering around my wonderful camp site, occasionally popping up to the summit to see how the changing light was affecting the views. I also had some hot food and found a good spot to indulge in a bit of reading whilst looking out over Glen Etive below me where there was still a lot of vehicular activity as Saturday afternoon drew to a close&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418310927/in/photostream/" title="Hazy light over Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418310927_3787d5fe4d_b.jpg" alt="Hazy light over Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By around 6pm the light had changed dramatically with the landscape turning coppery in the evening sun. The nose of the Buchaille was now deep in shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417486988/in/photostream/" title="Towards Lochaber"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417486988_e9e560ca63_b.jpg" alt="Towards Lochaber"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took another walk up to the summit of Creise. The hills were empty by this point, summit after summit fading off into the haze. The wind was still bitterly cold and blowing strongly. Over at the north top there was stunning light now catching just the very top of Meall a' Bhuiridh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Moon had risen over the Bridge of Orchy hills which were now glowing with a soft reddish light that spilled out over Rannoch Moor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417651218/in/photostream/" title="Moonrise over Beinn Dorain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417651218_97c40caf07_b.jpg" alt="Moonrise over Beinn Dorain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun dropped ever lower into the west, eventually sinking into a hazy layer of cloud that sadly robbed it of a final show. Gloaming spread across the mountains almost as soon as the sun disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418422811/in/photostream/" title="Sunset from Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418422811_716d6d8b8c_b.jpg" alt="Sunset from Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It cooled quickly after sunset and so I retired to the tent to enjoy a hot dinner and listen to a podcast or two cosied up in my sleeping bag. When I later went outside to brush my teeth the stars were out though it had remained a hazy evening. Mars burned red over Rannoch Moor and Jupiter and Saturn shone brightly in the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418622782/in/photostream/" title="Auriga and the Pleiades"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418622782_2795162bf6_b.jpg" alt="Auriga and the Pleiades"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunday 27th September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back to the tent and headed to sleep, not waking up again until around 3am when it had grown noticeably colder. Looking outside, the haze had disappeared completely and the sky shone with stars. Orion had now risen over the ridge to the southeast and in the west the Milky Way could easily be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417781758/in/photostream/" title="Winter skies from Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417781758_69775b4143_b.jpg" alt="Winter skies from Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put on an extra insulating layer and zipped up my sleeping bag against the chill, soon drifting back off to sleep. I next awoke with the faint light of pre-dawn filtering into the tent. Orion could be seen over Creise with Venus shining like a spotlight in the south. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418481191/in/photostream/" title="Orion over Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418481191_b1034d15a4_b.jpg" alt="Orion over Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dozing for a while longer I finally got out of the tent about 15 minutes before sunrise. The views were beautiful with a very light mist filling all the glens and straths around, the mountain tops rising clear above it all. The water on Rannoch Moor was picked out under the rapidly lightening sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed up to the summit of Creise, soon spotting a fellow pair of early risers on the neighbouring summit of Meall a' Bhuiridh. There was barely any remnant of the strong, cold wind that had been blowing the previous evening and so I was able to stand comfortably at the summit cairn waiting for the sun to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418683672/in/photostream/" title="People on Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418683672_e9f0157acf_b.jpg" alt="People on Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 07:11 the sun crested the Lawers Range far off in Perthshire. It was a magical moment. The light quickly spread, lighting up the curving ridge of Creise and the higher summits to my north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418737402/in/photostream/" title="Sunrise from Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418737402_5bde54c087_b.jpg" alt="Sunrise from Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My intention at this point was to head back to bed and get another hour or so of sleep, but the early light was intoxicating and I ended up staying outside and watching as everything gradually lit up. It was particularly apparent as the sun increasingly illuminated the rocks of the Buchaille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50417916258/in/photostream/" title="Alpenglow on Ben Nevis"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50417916258_c773c6f110_b.jpg" alt="Alpenglow on Ben Nevis"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light spilled over a misty Rannoch Moor, the haze lifting and catching the rays of the sun. Countless ridges and summits were picked up as the angle of the sun changed over the next half hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418001773/in/photostream/" title="Dawn over Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418001773_1d2a7608db_b.jpg" alt="Dawn over Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I tore myself from the show long enough to sit down at the tent and warm up with a hot breakfast. It was a pleasure after the cold night to feel the sun hit the tent and start to slowly warm it up. I lay back in my sleeping bag and dozed for about a half hour or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418938127/in/photostream/" title="Camped on Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418938127_e22a2471a4_b.jpg" alt="Camped on Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I emerged again it was to find a perfect Highland morning. Light cloud had built up slightly but it was still bright and sunny with barely a breath of wind. I still had a fair bit of ground to cover and so I slowly got everything packed away, happy to be taking down a dry and well-aired tent. I left behind nothing more than a faint impression in the grass - it had been the perfect campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a final walk up to the summit of Creise, enjoying the perfect solitude at this early hour on a Sunday morning. I thought the folk on Meall a' Bhuiridh at dawn might have come over here but never saw any sign of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418865376/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418865376_1819be1c6b_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418185718/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="West from Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418185718_377a5ff172_b.jpg" alt="West from Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed south, following the rough trail towards the middle top of the ridge where I would descend towards Meall a' Bhuiridh. As I was walking the quiet morning was punctuated by the thwump of distant rotor blades. I watched as a coastguard rescue helicopter flew low down Glen Etive, disappearing around the corner past the Buchaille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418901026/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rescue chopper over Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418901026_739af5765d_b.jpg" alt="Rescue chopper over Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419083562/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419083562_382e8f70e5_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the top of the ridge I took one last look at the panorama of hills. In the far distance across Rannoch Moor I could clearly identify the Glen Roy hills I had been on the previous month, with Ben Alder also close by. A few puddles of water gathered in the hollows of rocks were frozen solid, showing it had been an icy night up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418932731/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Towards Ben Alder"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418932731_cc541a4015_b.jpg" alt="Towards Ben Alder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418248688/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418248688_bc1321c129_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped down from the plateau onto the ridge. It's steepest at the top and there were a couple of scrabbly steps to negotiate but otherwise the descent presented very little difficulty. The views quickly opened out over Coire an Easain where two or three stags could be heard bellowing, their calls echoing off the steep cliffs on either side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418992331/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Coire an Easain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418992331_5023469079_b.jpg" alt="Coire an Easain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418325298/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Creise"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418325298_e773786778_b.jpg" alt="Creise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made quick progress down to the low point where the Kingshouse could be seen down by the main road, and Meall a' Bhuiridh dominated the view ahead. Behind me the rough ridge could be better appreciated as it climbed back up to Creise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419257682/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419257682_006a441c99_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I regained height quickly. The ridge was again fairly straightforward with a clear path to follow over some rocky ground. At a couple of points there were opportunities for some very mild scrambling. I finally met people coming over towards Creise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418459763/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Creise from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418459763_fd6c908104_b.jpg" alt="Creise from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views opened back out over Rannoch Moor and towards the Bridge of Orchy as I neared the summit. Loch Tulla could be seen, utterly still. I could see the line of the West Highland Way crossing the open terrain on the edge of the moor - I would soon be down there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419161161/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Southeast from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419161161_494c08b765_b.jpg" alt="Southeast from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon emerged onto the rough summit area marked by a small cairn. This marked the final summit of the Clachlet Traverse. The views stretched out across Rannoch Moor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418515468/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418515468_4aab143dd0_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418559173/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Southern Highlands from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418559173_c77f13f38b_b.jpg" alt="Southern Highlands from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the summit to myself for a few minutes before the strange sight of three people in orange high-vis clothing appeared. It turned out they were Network Rail technicians up here to work on the radio signalling equipment that lives on top of the mountain. A subsequent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetworkRailSCOT/status/1313135270569693185"&gt;tweet from Network Rail itself revealed their purpose&lt;/a&gt; in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419254251/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Summit of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419254251_f2e9a0be71_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people eventually reached the summit and after a couple of pleasant conversations I decided it was time to head off. The upper part of the mountain is rocky, but a clear track zig zags down on the western side, far away from the ski paraphernalia. A mountain rescue person, evidently out for some exercise, passed me as we descended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419430337/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Clach Leathad from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419430337_03cee489b9_b.jpg" alt="Clach Leathad from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419439602/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Upper slopes of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419439602_7e8346dd4f_b.jpg" alt="Upper slopes of Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were good views as I descended but all too soon I came to the top of the main part of the ski centre. Here I lost the path, and not having done any research, decided the best thing would be to follow one of the vehicle tracks down to the main buildings below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419273926/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rannoch Moor from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419273926_aaca323010_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419284216/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Creise from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419284216_89800fc66c_b.jpg" alt="Creise from Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound past various buildings and then down the length of a chairlift that was still under construction. I came down to the big building which turned out to be at the top of the main chairlift coming up from the car park. It was very popular with mountain bikers who were coming up in droves, grabbing their bikes and heading back down the mountain. According to the map there was a path that would cut off a corner over to the WHW but now on the ground it seemed that at least the first part of this was being used by bikes going quite quickly. I decided instead to follow the footpath down to the car park and pick up the WHW from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418602733/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418602733_52e4086bab_b.jpg" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Bhuiridh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footpath was fairly busy, though less so than the chairlift, and although boggy in places, provided a reasonably quick descent down the last slope. I trooped through the car park and was very glad to pick up a linking path that soon took me to the WHW as it came up from the direction of the Kingshouse Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419479727/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Glencoe Ski Centre"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419479727_a36309bae5_b.jpg" alt="Glencoe Ski Centre"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away from the hustle and bustle I found it relatively quiet on the WHW, though it was slightly irksome to have to immediately regain height. The benefit of this were the excellent views behind me into Glencoe, a view so familiar from the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50418630193/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Glencoe from the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50418630193_db7259dc8e_b.jpg" alt="Glencoe from the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light was fairly hazy now but there were still good views across the Moor. This is one of the highlights of the WHW and I now was able to amble along at a comfortable pace, enjoying the sights of Rannoch Moor from this different and more elevated vantage point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50419324636/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rannoch Moor from the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50419324636_662ee8e604_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor from the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I rounded the corner at the top of the hill to start my descent towards the River Ba and the looming Black Mount hills I met one of the couples I had spoken to on the Clachlet Traverse the previous day. After confirming I had had an excellent overnight camp they happily told me it was all downhill for me from here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50424126742/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50424126742_040af1c06a_b.jpg" alt="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Way is pretty hard going on the feet, being a mixture of vehicle track and embedded rock, but it did make for fast progress. I passed walkers every few minutes but it wasn't really that busy for a sunny Sunday afternoon. The Black Mount hills grew closer and it was fun to follow the line of summits I had traversed heading north. The east ridge of Meall a' Bhuiridh looked fine and would have offered a good shortcut, avoiding most of the ski centre woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50423970551/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50423970551_668f94465e_b.jpg" alt="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed the ruin of the Ba Cottage and then reached the River Ba where I turned aside briefly to have a lunch stop whilst my feet cooled off in the water. It was exceedingly pleasant in the warm sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50423284728/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Black Mount from the River Ba"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50423284728_0e69b84131_b.jpg" alt="Black Mount from the River Ba"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50423299788/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Ba Bridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50423299788_db3d81072a_b.jpg" alt="Ba Bridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it was then a final up and over the last hill, with the hills beyond Loch Tulla growing ever closer. Behind me I had a last view of the Black Mount hills with Creise and Meall a' Bhuiridh both disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50424011176/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Lochan Mhic Pheadair Ruaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50424011176_1855ba2e0f_b.jpg" alt="Lochan Mhic Pheadair Ruaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50424025966/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50424025966_1fcd626527_b.jpg" alt="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was then a final descent along the edge of the plantation which led to a short stretch amongst brighter, more native woodland, with evidence of autumn appearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50423337138/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50423337138_2affe722da_b.jpg" alt="On the West Highland Way"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I knew it though I was at Forest Lodge, crossing Victoria Bridge and looking west to Stob Ghabhar and the views I had enjoyed the previous morning. The light was very different now and my feet were sore from the WHW so it felt good to roll up at the car, the full Clachlet Loop complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50423340193/in/album-72157716183172223/" title="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50423340193_c869fb09fb_b.jpg" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive back home was fairly boring, stuck in a long line of cars heading from Glencoe back towards the central belt. I did get home in time to enjoy a glass of fizz in the sunshine to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="wild camping"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="west highlands"></category></entry><entry><title>The Hills East of Glen Roy</title><link href="https://tms.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2020/08/east-glen-roy/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-29T10:40:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-08-29T10:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.invertedworld.co.uk,2020-08-29:/blog/2020/08/east-glen-roy/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overnight backpacking trip taking in a Corbett and three Munros to the east of Glen Roy in the West Highlands.

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday 29th August&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these strange Covid times seemingly the most important part of planning a hill walk is identifying a starting point where you won't be fighting for the last parking spot. Given that Glen Roy is typically used to access a handful of Corbetts, I decided it would be a good place to park up and then walk over to a couple of nearby Munros that were still on my target list, Beinn Teallach and Beinn a' Chaorainn, that are usually accessed from near Roughburn on the A85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in October 2010 I did &lt;a href="/blog/2010/10/creag-meagaidh/"&gt;the Creag Megaidh three via the standard route from Aberader on the shore of Loch Laggan&lt;/a&gt;, but I was keen to get back and figured a summit camp would extend the route nicely into a worthwhile overnight trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from this direction did mean some extra driving was required, but the opportunity to see Glen Roy and the famous "Parallel Roads" was enough to see me driving past Laggan and down to Roybridge where a single track road climbs up through wooded hills and then winds through this stunning, remote glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a mostly pleasant journey despite roadworks on the A9 upgrade near Perth and the first time I had come this particular way since moving to the central belt. My plan had worked out and I found a very empty parking area to pull up in just downstream of Braeroy Lodge. There was work ongoing closer to the lodge to install a mobile phone mast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note: Glen Roy is famous for the "parallel roads, a series of terraces carved into the sides of the glen which formed as a vast lake drained away to different levels as the glaciers retreated at the end of the last ice age. They are very obvious all the way along the glen and there is a car park much closer to Roybridge from where you can admire this strange post-glacial landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442103632/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442103632_98eed673b0_b.jpg" alt="Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short gear faff I was away, leaving the car in the care of a few sheep that were munching amongst the bracken by the river. I crossed the Roy River via the sturdy footbridge just short of Braeroy Lodge and started working my way uphill. I was aiming to pick up a slanting ridge that rose towards the summit of Carn Bhrunachain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441935716/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441935716_d901cc858d_b.jpg" alt="Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground was steep but presented no technical difficulties. I crossed the two major parallel roads and soon the views were opening up down the glen below me. The slanted ridge was also steep but gave me a rapid gain in height. I came across smatterings of blaeberries that the deer had missed and munched on these as I climbed. Down in the glen I watched a couple of pairs of cyclists head along the road towards Braeroy Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442138472/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Parallel Roads, Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442138472_66b3748106_b.jpg" alt="Parallel Roads, Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I got towards the top of the slope the views to the south opened up with the Grey Corries rising up beyond the hills of lower Glen Roy. In the distance further west the bulk of the Aonachs was hidden by dark clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442166617/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Glen Roy from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442166617_f43744d25a_b.jpg" alt="Glen Roy from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441382508/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Grey Corries from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441382508_0c6e223eaf_b.jpg" alt="Grey Corries from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally the slope relented and I picked my way up to the summit of Carn Bhrunachain. Strangely, anticipating being alone until I reached the Munros, I could see a couple of figures silhouetted on the summit of the nearby Corbett of Carn Dearg, which was my next target. Though the weather had been very pleasant up until now, the views north revealed that there were a few showers moving through on the cool northerly wind. Up on the tops it certainly didn't feel like the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the open ground and then worked my way up the final slopes of Carn Dearg, emerging onto the ridge just south of the summit and making my way up to the cairn. The two people had taken a more direct line off the summit so I could now see them heading to the hill I had just left. At this point the weather was pretty good with decent views south to the Grey Corries. The Aonachs were under a blanket of cloud, as was Creag Meagaidh off to my east, the Window a distinctive notch in the hills. Beinn Teallach, the neighbouring Munro looked very diminutive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441424353/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Southwest from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441424353_b64ca0eff5_b.jpg" alt="Southwest from Carn Bhrunachain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had my first view of the two Munros, Beinn Teallach and Beinn a' Chaorainn, that were my primary objectives for this trip. They stood above Loch Sguadaig and a wide area of boggy, wild ground that didn't look like it saw many people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I watched, the previously pleasant day quickly worsened with a squally shower blowing in. Thankfully it was quickly followed by sunshine and I watched as the light rapidly changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442376422/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="North over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442376422_11b80d8f58_b.jpg" alt="North over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short snack break I made my way off Carn Dearg, angling northeast and dropping down easy slopes towards the ground near Loch Sgurdaig. There was one short steep section down a greasy bank, but otherwise it was easy going on grass and tussock. The sun by now was shining again and down in the glen it was much warmer. I shed a layer or two before continuing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441508478/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Descent from Carn Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441508478_3e64b1813a_b.jpg" alt="Descent from Carn Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ground around the loch was boggy and there was a certain amount of bog hopping and peat wading as I made my way towards the green banks of a stream coming down from the western end of Beinn Teallach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442397397/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442397397_acb23ff9f7_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the stream led me up onto a loosely defined ridge that climbed steeply up this northwestern shoulder of Beinn Teallach. It was steep but grassy with sheep dotted about further above the slope and a few more blaeberries to snack on. The clouds rolled back in as I reached the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441547828/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441547828_babe38de62_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I had my first view down Loch Treig and saw that more showers were rolling through, both to my north and south. The weather forecast had said these should all have died out by now but it seemed they were around to stay. I now followed the higher ground as it swung in a big arc around towards the summit of Beinn Teallach at the eastern end of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441561723/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Lochaber from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441561723_2c9a1b8939_b.jpg" alt="Lochaber from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was quite rocky and there was no particularly direct route, but I made steady progress towards the summit, looping around high above Loch Sgaudaig and the distant hills marking the Burn of Agie that I would follow back the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442458807/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442458807_e5e6a8a696_b.jpg" alt="Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just before the final climb I found a good spot out of the wind and stopped for a lunch break with views towards Loch Treig. The clouds continued to build and it felt much cooler when I finally headed up to the cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442296311/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="West from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442296311_3fa290d4e0_b.jpg" alt="West from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442484552/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Summit of Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442484552_69b5851679_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two cairns on two separate summits separate by a narrow gully. I visited both, although unfortunately now the weather had closed in around me and I was in an unpleasant cloud. Despite hanging around, getting colder and colder, it never really brightened again and eventually I decided it was time to be moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441622113/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Summit of Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441622113_b54150be6e_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now being on the bagger's route there was a clear path heading down the northeast ridge of Beinn Teallach. Beinn a' Chaorainn could be glimpsed across the narrow glen separating the two hills, its upper slopes disappearing into the clag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442502617/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Mist over Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442502617_7784a91893_b.jpg" alt="Mist over Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I descended there was a brief clearing in the weather and I had a sweeping view northward where a rainbow was tracking along the line of the Roy River.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442535557/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Rainbow over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442535557_fb37dc58bb_b.jpg" alt="Rainbow over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually though this shower made its way to where I was and resulted in the longest and most drenching downpour of the afternoon. I lost the path on the lower, wet slopes and cut directly down the final slopes of Tom Mor and then across the boggy bealach to reach the slopes of Beinn a' Chaorainn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442551207/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="North from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442551207_67bf7fe23a_b.jpg" alt="North from Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rain driving into me from the north, I put on my waterproof and plodded upwards, hoping the shower wouldn't last for too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442398251/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Mist over Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442398251_ca9ff2c19a_b.jpg" alt="Mist over Beinn Teallach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steep section of climbing to gain the broad ridge was soon over and with it came an improvement in the weather. The surrounding hills were once again revealed and I was able to peel the waterproofs back off. The plateau was grassy and easy underfoot as I turned south towards the first top on the Beinn a' Chaorainn plateau. There were more showers in the north but it looked like I would enjoy at least twenty or so minutes of sunshine before the next band arrived!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442422161/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Loch Sguadaig from Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442422161_2b9f22d0e1_b.jpg" alt="Loch Sguadaig from Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Creag Meagaidh now looking much closer to hand I finally got up to the North Top of Beinn a' Chaorainn just as the next band of weather arrived. Visibility plummeted to just a short distance in front of me as I arrived at the cairn. The gloomy crags marking the actual Munro summit could just be seen through the clag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50441752323/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Loch Treig through the mist"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50441752323_36c472e39b_b.jpg" alt="Loch Treig through the mist"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a fine ridge which curves around part of the eastern lip of the massive Coire na h-Uamha. This would be a spectacular section of walking on a better day. I was soon climbing up to the summit cairn marking the 1,052m Munro. It was cold and damp and I found a sheltered spot to have a sit and see if conditions would improve at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442682442/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Summit cairn on Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442682442_63d674e215_b.jpg" alt="Summit cairn on Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left my bag at the summit and briefly headed over to the south top. Again, there were glimpses of views over Fersit towards Loch Treig, with some heavy showers coming down towards Laggan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442691177/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn South Top"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442691177_a1cc513bdf_b.jpg" alt="Beinn a&amp;#x27; Chaorainn South Top"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After it became clear that the views weren't going to improve any time soon I returned to the main summit for a quick snack break and then headed back to the north top, this time continuing onto the east ridge and heading towards Creag Meagaidh. There was something of a path and the ridge was gently angled making for some good walking despite the weather conditions. There were good views back across Coire na h-Uamha to the craggy heights of Beinn a' Chaorainn, impressive even through the murk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Bealach a' Bharnish I started up the long western shoulder of Creag Meagaidh. There was a line of fence posts paralleled by a clear track. As I climbed the clouds parted a little and it was brighter for a while as I gained height. Behind me I had a good view of Beinn a' Chaorainn and to the northwest I could see distant peaks arrayed under a band of clouds. There were still a number of showers around and it didn't look promising for a clear summit camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the fence I gained height steadily until I was looking over the yawning Coire nan Laogh towards the ripples on the Creag Meagaidh plateau. I was hopefully of getting some views from the top but as I joined the final slope the cloud once again started moving in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the summit just before 6pm. The hills were quiet with just the sound of the wind whistling up and over the crags.There was a promise of some nice light in the northwest so I found a bit of shelter to see whether it would turn into anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some nice light at times but gradually more cloud swept in and the distant views were lost. Keen now to get the tent up I did a quick perusal of the map and the terrain below me. I wanted to drop down off the summit to get some shelter from the wind and though my initial plan had been to camp above one of the great eastern coires, I now decided to try an area just below the summit which had the advantage of being much closer and sheltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped down off the summit and soon came to a promising looking area. There was a small area of flattish land just before it dropped down into a rocky bowl below the summit. Here I found a good spot for the tent - it wasn't perfectly level but I thought it would do the job. Despite not having wild camped for more than four years I got the tent up without much trouble and soon had everything unpacked. It seemed like there might be some nice light in the evening so I filled up my water bottle from a nearby trickle and settled in to get some hot food. It really didn't feel like August in the hills as I pulled on hat and glove and every layer of insulation I had brought with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As dusk approached there was some nice light over the Beinn Eibhinn range towards Ben Alder, but it was relatively fleeting and as night fell a light rain started falling. I retired to my sleeping bag to enjoy a podcast episode or two before drifting off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442716701/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Sunlight on the Beinn Eibhinn hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442716701_64fe32454e_b.jpg" alt="Sunlight on the Beinn Eibhinn hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday 30th August&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I awoke to cloying mist shrouding the world around me. There were no views and so I had a lazy breakfast, staying in my warm sleeping bag for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50305909333/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Morning on Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50305909333_f6496548fa_b.jpg" alt="Morning on Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After packing everything up and making sure I left nothing except a patch of flattened grass, I headed briefly back up to the summit which remained firmly in the clag. From here I headed east along the plateau, pausing briefly at Mad Meg's cairn and then dropping down to the bealach above the Window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442722901/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Summit of Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442722901_5930a0e6f7_b.jpg" alt="Summit of Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of people were just packing up their tent as I passed them by and struck out over the pathless terrain leading away west from the Window. I skirted along the shore of Lochan Uaine and the series of small tributary lochans that eventually flow out as the Uishe nam Fichead. This would serve me as a handrail all the way back to Glen Roy, though it was a fair distance away, 7 or 8km, with some twists and turns along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442734506/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442734506_e82558fba6_b.jpg" alt="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442749641/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442749641_2746dece6c_b.jpg" alt="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lochans were very atmospheric with the northern cliffs of Creag Meagaidh rising up into the mist beyond them. As I wandered along a steady rain started to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442758061/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442758061_ba8d4c51f2_b.jpg" alt="Lochan Uaine below Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442070538/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="On the north side of Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442070538_e337cc636a_b.jpg" alt="On the north side of Creag Meagaidh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first 3km there is no path marked on the OS map. On the ground there were occasional faint hints of a path but it was probably more deer than human made. Thankfully though the terrain on the north bank of the river proved fairly firm and a mixture of heather and tussock. Occasionally there was a side stream to negotiate but none of these proved much hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442764901/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Upper Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442764901_98acfdf35f_b.jpg" alt="Upper Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the low cloud and rain the views weren't particularly special but it was a privilege to walk through this quiet landscape, not a sign of humans in any direction. Eventually I got down to where the burn that drains out of the Coire Buidhe on the north side of Beinn a' Chaorainn joins the Uisge nam Fichead. Here there were some swarths of grass beside the river which would make for a pleasant campsite. Beyond this, at least according to the map, a path should begin. Unfortunately there was a reasonably sizeable landslip at the far end of this area which I got around by following the bank immediately above the water. Beyond this I finally picked up the path,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442075923/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Upper Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442075923_e023a7f344_b.jpg" alt="Upper Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path wasn't always the clearest and occasionally got lost in the bog but mostly helped me to follow the Uisge nam Fichead. The rain had petered out and it was a little brighter as I approached Crag Tharsuinn and the drop down towards the Burn of Agie which promised an interesting series of cascades. Behind me only the feet of Creag Meagaidh could be seen, receding into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442780391/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Creag Tharsuinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442780391_5cf5b41248_b.jpg" alt="Creag Tharsuinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon came to the first of these falls as the river dropped through a series of rocky bands. The path wound its way along the north bank and I kept leaving it to see the waterfalls. There was quite a range, with pools and rapids leading one into the next as I lost height. I was also cheered to see a few breaks in the cloud and the sun finally making an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442973427/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Waterfalls on the Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442973427_9b62ca3af8_b.jpg" alt="Waterfalls on the Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down, after seeing a rainbow, the sun truly came out and the day warmed up rapidly. I took a couple of layers off by the falls before continuing down, soon finding a narrow footbridge that would take me over to the south bank just as the gorge ended and the river widened once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50443023532/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Waterfalls on the Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50443023532_ae80599aa7_b.jpg" alt="Waterfalls on the Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path was very boggy beyond the bridge and so it was good to get back down to the river side as it curved around towards Glen Roy. As it was almost lunchtime I decided to stop here in the sunshine for lunch. It was exceedingly pleasant, to the point where the midges eventually found me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442874911/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="The Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442874911_9cd5d93e5c_b.jpg" height="683" alt="The Uisge nam Fichead"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch it was clear that the good weather was only going to be brief. I picked up the path which now started to climb up to the final shoulder separating me from Glen Roy. Behind me a shower was rushing down from the high ground and caught me as I crested the path. I stopped to put on waterproofs and then continued, now dropping down on an excellent path into Glen Roy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of zig-zags and then I was crossing boggy ground to reach the small cottage at Annat. Here a vehicle track was picked up which took me down to the Roy River. The parallel roads were immediately obvious on the surrounding hillsides which were now bright in the returning sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/50442897341/in/album-72157716327550832/" title="Showers over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50442897341_c881c42e2f_b.jpg" alt="Showers over Glen Roy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn't much further to go now and it was a simple case of following the track through Glen Roy. I crossed the river on a sturdy bridge just before Braeroy Lodge where a couple were enjoying a snack break. I made my way along to the Turret Bridge which was framed nicely by purple heather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the track past Braeroy Lodge which was simultaneously both very quiet and seemed a hive of activity with some generators droning away in outbuildings and a couple of vehicles moving around. Once past the trees I came out at the mast construction site where people were camped by the river and eventually reached the car to finish a very satisfying loop, despite the vagaries of the late August weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a break at the car before starting the long drive back. On the way out of the glen I stopped at the viewpoint to take in the scenic views of the parallel roads. Then it was just a case of the long drive road which passed quickly as I listened to almost the entire second series of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2"&gt;13 Minutes to the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, a highly recommended podcast from the BBC World Service concerning the dramatic story of Apollo 13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 23rd June 2019&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 9.5km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,028m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 4hrs&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Garbh Bheinn (Corbett)&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Hot and sunny to begin with but clouding over later  &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/479"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was just a short drive from our holiday cottage around to the parking area near Inversanda Bay which forms the access point for the standard route up Garbh Bheinn. It was a hot June day and the sun was beating down as we emerged from the trees by the river and made our way across the undulating ground to the foot of Sron a' Garbh Choire Bhig. I was a little worried whether we would find enough water on the long pull up the Sron but this proved unfounded as Cob managed to find and sample just about every single pool and puddle of water on the way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48133935701/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Coire an Iubhair, Ardgour"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48133935701_a766387c85_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Coire an Iubhair, Ardgour"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial ascent is on a fairly clear and well worn path that winds itself up the lower slopes of Sron a' Garbh Choire Bhig. The views soon opened up over Inversanda bay behind us and across the waters of Loch Linnhe to the Ballachulish hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134052622/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Inversanda Bay on Loch Linnhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134052622_d1b1dba678_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Inversanda Bay on Loch Linnhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134020283/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="The path up Sron a&amp;#x27; Garbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134020283_cd5d6b5d79_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The path up Sron a&amp;#x27; Garbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher up the ground was rockier and the path became less defined but there was no difficulty in finding a way up. It was hot work with almost no respite from the steep gradient but as we climbed higher there was a steady build up of cloud which started to take away some heat from the day. Behind us the views were opening out to encompass the Ballachulish bridge, Loch Leven and the Glencoe hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134144492/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Beinn Bheag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134144492_153d476b66_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Bheag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134148042/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Ballachulish Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134148042_db4cf666f5_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ballachulish Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little more effort and we were approaching the top of the Sron and looking across the Glen to Creach Bheinn a little further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134043193/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Towards Creach Bheinn and Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134043193_caefa43027_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Creach Bheinn and Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came out on the rocky summit of Sron a' Garbh Choire Bhig, marked by a small cairn, which suddenly revealed the dramatic buttressed eastern flank of Garbh Bheinn beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134156468/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Summit of Sron a&amp;#x27; Gharbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134156468_bbf4ee7816_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Sron a&amp;#x27; Gharbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134189148/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Garbh Bheinn and Ardgour"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134189148_523e2fa362_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Garbh Bheinn and Ardgour"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short break here we continued on, dropping down the rocky slopes to curve around the head of the dark coire below Garbh Bheinn's buttresses. I spotted a pair of climbers high on the face with their dog, intrigued by Cob, patiently keeping watch from a wide ledge. We made quick progress around to the slopes of Garbh Bheinn itself, the views changing and opening up as we regained height. Off the in the distance Loch Linnhe appeared again where it seemed the good weather was holding on better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134204823/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134204823_46798c697b_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134225723/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Ballachulish from Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134225723_412e8af773_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ballachulish from Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134247078/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Looking back to Sron a&amp;#x27; Gharbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134247078_3fa76faa77_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Looking back to Sron a&amp;#x27; Gharbh Choire Bhig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rocky path moves slightly away from the precipitous edge and then without very much drama rapidly ascends to the head north-east towards the summit, finally coming along the very edge of the buttresses. The summit cairn soon came into view and we were up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134350757/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Summit of Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134350757_87d8dfffcc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a grand perch, the views muted slightly by the grey cloud that had built up in the west and taken much of the life and colour out of the views down to Loch Sunart and the hills of Ardnamurchan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134286198/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Ballachulish from Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134286198_bf549e01f1_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ballachulish from Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134234111/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Loch Sunart and Beinn Resipol"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134234111_325b4a3bbc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Sunart and Beinn Resipol"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another break to take in this magnificent spot we headed over the undulating ground towards the western top to see what the views into Ardnamurchan and Ardgour would be like from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134314223/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Beinn Resipol and Cob"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134314223_216f65cf5a_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Beinn Resipol and Cob"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy going, weaving over rocky outcrops and around a couple of pools of water. Soon we were at this second vantage point looking down the length of Gleann Feith 'n Amean as it wound down towards Loch Sunart. Below us to the left we could hear the distant sound of occasional traffic passing through on its way to Strontian. There were good views back east to the rugged slopes of Garbh Bheinn and Sron a' Garbh Choire Bhig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134615597/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134615597_e3deeffef8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134528697/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Towards Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134528697_e3d719eb16_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134533047/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Towards Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134533047_d22efe3e34_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Loch Sunart"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could see far off into the Northwest Highlands and out beyond the dark outline of &lt;a href="/blog/2013/11/ben-resipole/"&gt;Ben Resipol&lt;/a&gt; could be glimpsed islands and the western sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134545647/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Towards the Northwest Highlands"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134545647_79c7522bb6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards the Northwest Highlands"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an extended break here it was time to be heading back. Rather than re-ascending back up to the summit of Garbh Bheinn we dropped off the west top and then contoured around the southern slopes to rejoin the path as it dropped down to the bealach. Heading this way we now had a view ahead over Loch Linnhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134603413/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Loch Linnhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134603413_8298e8ee6f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Linnhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134740958/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Ardnamurchan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134740958_cc3f658f39_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ardnamurchan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134699471/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Towards Ballachulish"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134699471_1d6ae69927_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Ballachulish"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rejoined the outward path and dropped down the scrabbly slopes to the bealach. From here Ben Nevis stood out bright against the murk to the north and I enjoyed the views once again onto the rocky slopes of Garbh Bheinn. There was a final glimpse through a gap towards Ardnamurchan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134801181/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134801181_6a84662227_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134911172/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134911172_09258ef12f_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Garbh Bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We climbed back up Sron a' Garbh Choire Bhig, again circumventing the actual summit by following the broad southern slopes. As we came back around to the east ridge the view opened out across Loch Linnhe to the Ballachulish hills and Glencoe which were now dramatically dark under brooding clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/48134854821/in/album-72157709265661582/" title="Dramatic light over the Ballachulish Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48134854821_4bc1397848_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Dramatic light over the Ballachulish Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly dropped down the ridge, picking a slightly different line to the ascent but encountering no particular difficulties on the rocky ground. Ahead the clouds across Loch Linnhe were slowly lighting up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we dropped back down towards Inversanda bay the sun finally found a gap in the clouds and the landscape around us lit up once more. It made for a very pleasant final half mile or so across the lumpy ground to reach the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday 15th August 2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the week I had planned two different possible routes for the coming weekend, hoping to take advantage of some good weather in the North West Highlands. In the end the weather forecast that appeared on Friday afternoon switched the good weather to the Central Highlands and so I threw out the planned routes, grabbed a map from the shelf and decided to do something completely different. This new plan would see me finishing off the cluster of hills that lie between Loch Ericht and Loch Treig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a wet drive across the country I pulled into the large parking area at Fersit, off the A82, a little after midday. The heavy rain through Speyside had fizzled out leaving a cool, overcast day. Although the temperature felt quite autumnal, summer’s lingering presence was made clear as a swarm of midges started to gather around me as I changed my shoes and sorted out my pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20687356356/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The Loch Treig Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5769/20687356356_9c1ce45b4a_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="The Loch Treig Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After very little ado I was off, threading my way between the small collection of buildings at Fersit and finally making my way towards the open hillside and the right of way that runs around to Corrour Station. The last obstacle was the slightly worrying presence of a bull (identified by the nose ring) standing just off the track. I gave him plenty of room and was glad to reach the path that winds its way across the boggy ground below the Munros of Stob Coire Sgriodan and Chno Dearg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20093027583/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Scotways signage on the route to Ossian"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5835/20093027583_26088f2a58_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Scotways signage on the route to Ossian"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was still cloud lingering over the Creag Meagaidh group but generally, despite the occasional spell of drizzle, the day seemed to be improving. The path climbed up and then plunged into a wood for a very boggy stretch. After passing the ruins of a house I started daydreaming enough to completely miss the path as it headed upwards and out of the trees. The vehicle track I was now on continued on its boggy way through the woods and a quick glance at the map reassured me that I was likely to meet the main road through to Ossian at some point. This duly happened and I turned south making my way eventually out of the trees and on to the moorland above Loch Guilbhin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20527321679/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Across to the Aonach Beag group"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/20527321679_b4641201cd_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Across to the Aonach Beag group"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road is a bit depressing to walk along, wide and stony and looks out of place in this wild landscape, but it got me where I needed and the views across to the Beinn Eibhinn range are fantastic. I could easily trace my route of descent from a fantastic high wild camp I had there back in June 2012, and then my long loop around to get back to Fersit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20091738584/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Ghuilbinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/697/20091738584_4f7baa0f6a_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Ghuilbinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I wound down to a corner above the loch where I stopped for a late lunch. I had been walking for a couple of hours and Beinn na Lap was now just coming into view in the distance beyond the white house at Strathossian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20714336715/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Ghuilbinn and Strath Ossian"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/618/20714336715_076e96d36f_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Loch Ghuilbinn and Strath Ossian"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road now led me along the strath, passing above the house and then reaching a bridge across the Allt Feith Tuill where harebells lined the stony banks. Here I was glad to leave the road and take a grassy track following the south bank of the allt up towards the narrow glen separating Beinn na Lap from Chno Dearg now visible ahead with a lingering snow patch crowning the wall of its eastern coire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20529609729/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Harebells"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5658/20529609729_dc765eb50c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Harebells"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20529654219/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Looking up the Allt Feith Thuill"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5755/20529654219_0681bfde31_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Looking up the Allt Feith Thuill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short distance I left the path and started to climb boggy ground to reach the nose at the northern end of Beinn na Lap’s long arm. There were a few crags to wind around and between but soon I was up the steepest part of the &lt;em&gt;sron&lt;/em&gt; and onto the broad ridge. Behind me there were excellent views to Loch Guilbhinn and the distant hills around Loch Laggan. A patchwork of sunlight was cast across the land as the overcast skies gradually broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20528565630/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Light and shade on the way to Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5645/20528565630_c8dd19bf7c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Light and shade on the way to Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad ridge rises gradually over a few kilometres and there was ample time and opportunity to watch the light changing over the surrounding hills. Ben Alder came into view some way off in the distance beyond the grey waters of Loch na Lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20716592275/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Ben Alder and Loch na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/653/20716592275_9d7c9e9a9e_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Ben Alder and Loch na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the summit of Beinn na Lap neared it got a little rockier and slightly more slender as you swing around the side of the northeastern coire but then the top levels off and it is easy over a little boulder field to reach the large summit cairn. Just as I was approaching from the north a couple reached the summit from the south and sat down in the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530060589/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Beinn na Lap from the north"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5811/20530060589_242381fbae_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Beinn na Lap from the north"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was quite ferocious at this point, whipping across the exposed summit and so I circled the cairn and found myself a spot to sit just off the summit to the east with a view down to the wooded banks of Loch Ossian. The broken clouds coalesced and threatened rain but nothing came of it. I enjoyed a second lunch and then once the couple moved off, I headed up to the summit to have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20690681396/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Summit of Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5740/20690681396_d3b6f1b366_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Summit of Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20716935715/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Towards Glen Nevis from Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/601/20716935715_0a5d50d168_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Towards Glen Nevis from Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20723819011/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Ben Alder and Loch Ossian from Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5733/20723819011_f4b65f58b0_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Ben Alder and Loch Ossian from Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530448419/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Towards Schiehallion"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5772/20530448419_c59ec198a5_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Towards Schiehallion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind was still gusting strongly but the sunshine reappeared, casting a new light on the summit area which looked quite inviting for a high summit camp. Tempting as it was though I was keen to cover a little more distance and get the other big ascent of this route over and done with before stopping for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly I left the summit of Beinn na Lap and headed off towards the southwest. The slope soon revealed itself as steep but grassy and I picked my way carefully down to the floor of the glen where I kept north to avoid a significant area of peat hags and bog around a small muddy lochan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20707992962/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The upper Allt Feith Thuill"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5685/20707992962_beb802eb5c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="The upper Allt Feith Thuill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After refilling my water bottle in the stream it was then straight back up the eastern slope of Garbh-bheinn, regaining all the elevation that I had just lost. Again the slope was steep but easy enough on grass and short heather. I followed a trickling burn with the thought I might want to fill my reservoir up before reaching the summit but in the end there was water all the way up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530595379/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Southwards to Leum Uilleim"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/710/20530595379_84a6455e17_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Southwards to Leum Uilleim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I was on the top of the ridge, a gently angled slope leading up from the railway line. I was at a point just a short distance away from where it levelled off to the 857m high summit but the wind was gusty so I stayed where I was as it seemed a little more sheltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20717418765/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/649/20717418765_b4e29c9d6c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick scout around I found what I thought was a decent patch of soft ground that, with the tent angled just so, would give me a level pitch. Once the tent was up I went slightly downhill to fetch some water, only then realising from a distance how not-at-all-level the tent was. Near the water I found a nice level patch of ground and so quickly relocated the tent downhill on to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530694129/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Wild camping on Garbh-bheinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5664/20530694129_17a79c8153_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Wild camping on Garbh-bheinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530624359/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Light rays over Rannoch"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/577/20530624359_366618b134_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Light rays over Rannoch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was sorted nicely just in time as the skies clouded over and a light rain started. Inside I cooked up some pasta and put on a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20724536801/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The hills of Glencoe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/611/20724536801_d0b9ac2c6e_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="The hills of Glencoe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour or so later the rain had cleared and the evening was looking much more promising. Outside the tent I found myself a nice seat and settled in to cook some dinner and watch the sun dipping towards the Easains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20529552360/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Binnein Mor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5802/20529552360_6174b3e8c4_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Binnein Mor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20096688573/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Wild camping"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5805/20096688573_d48d43a969_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Wild camping"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was still cloud and mist around blocking the best views but the Mamores were visible as well as a wide swathe of the central-southern Highlands from Lawers to Bridge of Orchy. Through a gap in the hills I could see the silvered surface of the Blackwater Reservoir and beyond it the hills of Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20717847925/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Looking south from Garbh-beinn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5724/20717847925_47788d48ac_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Looking south from Garbh-beinn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20529906650/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Evening light on Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5661/20529906650_5b473531b2_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Evening light on Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a wonderful evening, warm in the sunshine and I sat outside for a couple more hours until the sun finally sank behind clouds to the west. There was very little colour in the sky and it got cold quickly so I retired to the tent to wrap up in my sleeping bag and read some of Carrot Quinn’s Pacific Crest Trail memoir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20718004285/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Sunset light on Ben Alder"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/646/20718004285_5258a4549f_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Sunset light on Ben Alder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20724854531/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Twilight over the Western Highlands"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/619/20724854531_197fac21b9_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Twilight over the Western Highlands"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20097031293/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Sunset over the Easains"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/759/20097031293_471e8ececf_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Sunset over the Easains"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around midnight I had a look outside and found a star-studded sky, the Milky Way a pale arc across the top of the sky directly above the tent. I sat back for a while, spotting three faint, fast moving and very brief meteors (likely Perseids which had peaked earlier in the week). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20530033040/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Stars and Aurora"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/664/20530033040_4183a42053_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Stars and Aurora"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if I had realised I should have been looking to the north as a display of the aurora was visible from Scotland (for much better photos see &lt;a href="http://wildaboutscotland.com/2015/08/16/seeing-the-northern-lights-in-august/"&gt;this post from Ewan over at Wild About Scotland&lt;/a&gt;) but I only realised this when I looked at the photographs I had taken and spotted a red glow in the corner of one. Sadly I was sleepy and cold and didn’t spend the time I should have to get a good focus so my few star shots are blurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday 16th August 2015&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud had rolled in overnight and I woke to a cool, damp morning. I’d set my alarm for sunrise but at 5am the conditions were definitely not looking good so I’d rolled over and slept another couple of hours. Looking out at around 7 the clouds were brushing the summits of the neighbouring Munros. The forecast had been for an improving day so I decided to relax for a couple of hours and see what happened. With my Kindle providing entertainment I lazed around drinking a couple of hot drinks and slowly making my way through a series of small breakfasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20741659705/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Scarp 1 above Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5719/20741659705_dc55c6f539_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Scarp 1 above Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the weather improved to the point where most of the nearby summits were appearing below the clag. I got everything packed up and set off north, following the easy ground across Garbh-beinn towards the top of Meall Garbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20715508616/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig and Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/671/20715508616_2e65411d97_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig and Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large herd of deer were gathered on the slopes of the Munro top but moved off as I approached. Off to the northeast there were views across Strathossian towards the Ben Alder hills, still mostly swathed in cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20555039339/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Towards the Ben Alder hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5739/20555039339_a1fb0d55a4_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Towards the Ben Alder hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20119303964/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Ghuilbinn and the Ben Alder hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/644/20119303964_79c72a815c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Ghuilbinn and the Ben Alder hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I climbed up the slopes of Meall Garbh, entering the cloud as I gained the final few metres to the summit. There were patches of sunlight appearing on distant hills though and as I crossed between the twin summits the cloud started to thin and lift until I could see the final climb to the summit of Chno Dearg ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20119508394/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Mist over Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5790/20119508394_1d85df7646_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Mist over Beinn na Lap"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20554369050/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The southern slopes of Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5709/20554369050_fc883bcf38_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="The southern slopes of Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off to the left there was a view around the head of the coire to Stob Coire Sgriodain, the trip's final Munro which was now completely clear of cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20742381065/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/612/20742381065_b4c04919e4_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way towards Chno Dearg, following a rough track through the short grass and clipped heather. Behind me sunlight was appearing over Loch Ossian and I could see the rough and craggy eastern side of Meall Garbh with Beinn na Lap beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20119790814/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Over the Loch Ossian hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/618/20119790814_7d90b777d4_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Over the Loch Ossian hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20742410165/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="East side of Meall Garbh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5770/20742410165_36c25e9c26_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="East side of Meall Garbh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way up to Chno Dearg was straightforward and the clag continued to move off as I arrived at the rocky summit area. There were improving views all around, to the Alder hills, to Laggan and away towards the Easains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20749506491/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Summit of Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/726/20749506491_69d0666929_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Summit of Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20121572123/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Laggan and Ardverickie from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5736/20121572123_dfcf56ac1c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Laggan and Ardverickie from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunlight was streaming down through gaps in the clouds over the Ossian hills and towards Rannoch Moor as I sat down and enjoyed a late morning snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20120065304/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Rays over the Ossian hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/722/20120065304_dfceb10633_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Rays over the Ossian hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20742558005/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Ghuilbinn from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5715/20742558005_a8e8144c31_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Loch Ghuilbinn from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20121735153/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Ossian"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5681/20121735153_833f10cf9f_c.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Loch Ossian"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed over to the west side of the plateau where there views back south to where I had camped and across the coire with its lochan to the summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain. By this time the Easains had cleared too. In the distance to the north I could just about see my car parked up near Fersit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20554758380/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="South from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5761/20554758380_21a6079a49_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="South from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20733454672/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Stob Coire Sgriodain from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/779/20733454672_5143c56cf7_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Stob Coire Sgriodain from Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20554819120/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Fersit"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5762/20554819120_f0beeff376_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Fersit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent from Chno Dearg was easy and then I picked my way around the rough ground at the head of the coire to start on the series of rough tops that would lead me round to my final summit of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20742896235/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Along the tops of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/757/20742896235_efd262a4cb_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Along the tops of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From along here I finally got some views of Loch Treig as well as back across the coire to Chno Dearg. There was a path most of the way but at times it was fun to deviate on to some more scrambly, rocky ground that offered an alternative way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20733604412/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig and the Easains"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5688/20733604412_d8d1ba97f7_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig and the Easains"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20120406904/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Around the coire to Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5660/20120406904_45e4d6d166_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Around the coire to Chno Dearg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final top had a quartzite cairn and then there was a reasonably big drop down before the final climb up to the summit area of Stob Coire Sgriodain. I'd watched a couple of guys arrive at the summit and met them just as they were leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20555051900/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Towards the summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5830/20555051900_db1bd1df84_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Towards the summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20122117123/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Towards Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5756/20122117123_d99819efe4_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Towards Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20120503574/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5733/20120503574_36435b2149_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain is a great place, with wonderful views almost straight down to Loch Treig far below. Across the loch the twin peaks of the Easains rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20750037241/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/759/20750037241_006501afe7_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20555225488/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/731/20555225488_63b0e31429_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first overlook I made my way up to the summit cairn itself where there were good views to Loch Laggan and down Loch Treig towards the hills of Glencoe, still mostly lost in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20555257378/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Laggan and Ardverickie"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/586/20555257378_ae0073304e_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Laggan and Ardverickie"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20120805784/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/645/20120805784_55cf28bb06_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20556598189/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5790/20556598189_40130a5734_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20743384055/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The Easains"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5796/20743384055_7fedaf2911_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="The Easains"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance I could see Beinn na Lap and the area on Garbh-beinn where I had camped. I sat down by the cairn and had some lunch, surprised at how quet the hills were given the views and calm conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20122485403/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Beinn na Lap from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5661/20122485403_f124a732fd_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Beinn na Lap from Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally it was time to be heading down. I followed the north ridge as it curved its way around the western coire of the hill. Just as I stopped to get a final view of Loch Treig a couple came up and we had a good chat about the views and other hillswe had bagged in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20122530703/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig and the Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/640/20122530703_d015dcb743_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig and the Summit of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20717265466/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/693/20717265466_2721f993f8_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Loch Treig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was a simple matter of getting off the hill and back down to Fersit. Initally I followed the broad ridge but as this headed to the steeper nose I dropped into a gully that offered a slightly easier, albeit wetter descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20120985764/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Descent of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/642/20120985764_5774ed1edc_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Descent of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20121030234/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Descent of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/655/20121030234_2f3eefe7db_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Descent of Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took me down to the boggy, uneven and heathery area below the nose of Stob Coire Sgriodain. Eventually I managed to pick my way across to a path that offered a fairly straightforward route down, mostly following an allt as it tumbled down to Fersit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20750630981/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="Path below Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5627/20750630981_bb58c2025f_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="Path below Stob Coire Sgriodain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/20555744260/in/album-72157657487206871/" title="The path down to Fersit"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/691/20555744260_2d820f6f6c_c.jpg" width="800" height="534" alt="The path down to Fersit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a last bog to negotiate and then it was back through Fersit, avoiding dogs and watching as a maintenance truck clattered its way along the railway line heading for Tulloch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with a couple of gulps of very sweet cider, consumed sitting outside the Drover’s Inn in the late afternoon sunshine after a great day &lt;a href="/blog/2015/04/beinn-chabhair/"&gt;climbing Beinn Chabhair&lt;/a&gt; with Matt and Jenny. I was suddenly feeling energised and rather than taking the easy option - camping at Ben Glas Farm with an evening meal at the Drovers - I got in the car and, after a quick map check, headed south and west. I followed the main road around via Tarbet, Arrochar and the Rest and Be Thankful before pulling in to the walker’s car park at the head of Loch Fyne, just up from the famous &lt;a href="http://www.lochfyne.com/restaurant-oyster-bar/"&gt;oyster bar&lt;/a&gt;. It was about 6:15 with the sun due to set around 8:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17060175058" title="The Clachan Power Station Road by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7721/17060175058_226b2a6911_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Clachan Power Station Road"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening was as good as they get with a soft, golden light and a pleasant temperature. There was barely any breeze and the only sounds were the birds chirping and a farmer making his way along the track to feed his cattle. Although I was in the deep shade of the glen as I made my way past the hydro plant at Clachan, the far hillside was bathed in sunlight, the faded russet of last year's bracken stretching up to the crags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17040495257" title="Head of Loch Fyne by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8723/17040495257_47c664530b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Head of Loch Fyne"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gravel road beyond the hydro plant led me to the quarry workings which were quiet at this late hour of the day. I moved quickly between the large piles of gravel and stationary machinery, seemingly able to always make the right choice amongst the confusing maze of twists and turns. On the far side of the quarry I left the main glen road and followed a branching track that took me up to the forestry above Mark Park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only a couple of hours until sunset I was keen to find the shortest route up on to the western side of the glen where I hoped to find a good view out towards the west. The track climbed up through the still, tall pines where it was dusky and quiet before reaching the open hillside and continuing its climb up towards the bealach below Newton Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17247355431" title="Loch Fyne from above Mark Park plantation by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8696/17247355431_c38aeaf136_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Fyne from above Mark Park plantation"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did intend to go all the way up to the bealach and tackle the trackless slope up to the broad ridge of the 680m high Beinn Chas from there. However, as I gained height a quick survey of the hillside led me to conclude that a straight ascent wouldn’t have that many disadvantages and would hopefully buy me a few more minutes of daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later as I scrambled up through the dead bracken I was regretting that decision slightly, but as I gained height I got through the steepest part of the slope and soon found myself winding through crags and up the last couple of gullies before the gradient eased and I crossed the sloping ground up towards the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16625417824" title="Loch Fyne from the slopes of Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/16625417824_23931ec350_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Fyne from the slopes of Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was with great joy that I suddenly found myself with the sun shining straight in my eyes. It was 7:40, a full 50 minutes before sunset. I’d covered 5km and gained 680m of height from a sea level start in around 1.5 hours. There were grand views east and north east to the hills of Arrochar and across the reservoir of the Allt na Lairige to the Tyndrum hills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17061643989" title="Allt na Lairige beyond Glen Fyne by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8805/17061643989_01119d3bdc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Allt na Lairige beyond Glen Fyne"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17247844355" title="Arrochar hills from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8825/17247844355_f5bc107496_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arrochar hills from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of Beinn Chas is a long, undulating ridge that runs south west to north east. At its northern end it drops down to a complex bealach below the Munro of Beinn Bhuidhe, this trip’s main target. On the south western end it drops steeply down towards Loch Fyne with a wind farm straddling its upper slopes. This was invisible from the summit though, the only evidence of its existence being the pylons climbing up the hillside in Glen Fyne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17060059198" title="Beinn Bhuidhe from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7614/17060059198_17420d44d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way across to the summit cairn, crossing a low fence on the way, and then had a quick scout around for a spot to pitch the tent. After a reasonale dry spell most of the ground was suitable and I soon found a comfortable, flat spot just below the summit and adjacent to a small pool of calm water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17246057852" title="West from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8691/17246057852_96b07dd9da_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="West from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16625318554" title="Summit of Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8697/16625318554_74dc007374_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tent went up quickly in the still conditions and a snow bank on the eastern side of the summit yielded a good trickle of fresh water from which I filled up my Platypus for the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17247097781" title="Scarp pitched with Beinn Bhuidhe beyond by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7646/17247097781_c290f31f49_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Scarp pitched with Beinn Bhuidhe beyond"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was back to the tent to take in the views and enjoy the last warmth and sunlight of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17061566869" title="Towards Mull at sunset by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7690/17061566869_33ed41053f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="386" alt="Towards Mull at sunset"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got dinner on, a Chicken Korma curry with rice from Mountain Trails which proved very satisfying. As the stove was coming up to boil the sun dropped below the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17247377865" title="Stove at sunset by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8747/17247377865_7ab728e6b2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stove at sunset"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17045046439" title="Reflections at Sunset by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7725/17045046439_158d73a0a0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Reflections at Sunset"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17247327145" title="Sunset from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8740/17247327145_aacae5e4b8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunset from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The colours flared up as a burnt orange crept up from the hills of Mull which were dark silhouettes in the distance. The light faded and bright Venus was soon joined by the first twinkling stars of evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17245572132" title="Last light after sunset by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8803/17245572132_50f3c7765f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Last light after sunset"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time dinner was done, rounded off by a cuppa and a slice of battenberg cake, it was fully dark, the sky was full of stars and the temperature had fallen appreciably. I spent a while happily stargazing before getting into the sleeping bag for a cosy listen to The Outdoor Station - Bob’s fourth wild camp of his twelve month challenge was tonight's episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16627058033" title="Bee Hive Cluster and Leo above the tent by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7618/16627058033_8200583bf1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bee Hive Cluster and Leo above the tent"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17245519382" title="The Milky Way over Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8750/17245519382_b1eff15d96_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="The Milky Way over Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday 19th April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept really well after the long previous day, waking up just a few minutes before my alarm which had been set to catch the sunrise just after 6am. It was already bright outside and though I was warm and comfy I managed to rouse myself for a look about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17274240082" title="Beinn Bhuidhe before sunrise by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8756/17274240082_3865e13bf7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe before sunrise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sky was a wonderful shade of pinky-blue with pale clouds streaking across, particular east over the hills of Arrochar. As I paced about, the cool air catching the back of my throat, the sun appeared beyond the Tyndrum hills and the world lit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17250137306" title="Beinn Bhuidhe from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7677/17250137306_86ddb64a02_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17274359092" title="Arrochar hills before sunrise by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8823/17274359092_35c0e7266e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Arrochar hills before sunrise"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16655971723" title="First light from Beinn Bhas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7685/16655971723_953ed38d7c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="First light from Beinn Bhas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit cairn I watched as the morning light started to glide over the surrounding landscape until it finally touched the tent. A few of the Munros visible were attracting a little cloud cover but in broad terms it looked to be shaping up for a repeat of the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17274427742" title="Sunrise from the summit of Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7675/17274427742_a19c5b68ef_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunrise from the summit of Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16656083083" title="First light on Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7712/16656083083_6e4132cd2c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="First light on Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17276355535" title="West from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7675/17276355535_5cf352c76f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="West from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the tent I got hot water on for a camp mocha and enjoyed a healthy, hearty breakfast of two cereal bars, some cashew nuts and a pork pie…! Given that it was a long drive back to Aberdeen I was keen to be on my way, making the most of the good weather and getting up onto the Munro early to enjoy the solitude of this less visited corner of the Highlands. My overnight point had been chosen carefully - I now had just a couple of kilometres and very little height loss to reach the final climb up to the summit ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17276174931" title="Scarp 1 and Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8822/17276174931_bef5e85056_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Scarp 1 and Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 7:30 the tent was down and I was packed away, striding off along the ridge of Beinn Chas towards Beinn Bhuidhe, which looked reasonably close from here. The going was pretty easy, the ridge broad but undulating with the occasional bog or pool to avoid. I passed a strange looking research station and then the ground started to fall away to the bealach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17250749166" title="Arrochar from Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8734/17250749166_89b5fdca2a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arrochar from Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17250802126" title="On Beinn Chas heading north by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8806/17250802126_74e9950212_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On Beinn Chas heading north"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16654349374" title="Research station (?) on Beinn Chas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8788/16654349374_0cf14889a0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Research station (?) on Beinn Chas"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16654394234" title="Heading to Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7689/16654394234_c52b8bee61_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Heading to Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the ground was much more complex with more lochans to circumvent and narrow defiles that prevented me taking anything like a straight bearing. The sun was bright and macro-navigation was easy though as I made for a point which looked to be directly below the main weakness in Beinn Bhuidhe’s long , steep, eastern wall. There were still hanging cornices and snow patches evident in gullies but it mostly looked clear. My main concern was the north-eastern summit slopes where snow patches were likely to be holding on. I decided that the good weather the previous day would have encouraged at least a few visitors and so I was likely to find a well-stomped path through any lingering soft snow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17250926846" title="Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8780/17250926846_195843d2b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there were grand views back across Glen Fyne to the reservoir of An Lairige with the Crianlarich hills emerging from the early haze. I also got my first look at an ugly new hilltrack which has been bulldozed to within just a couple of hundred metres of the foot of Beinn Bhuidhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17250891356" title="Across Glen Fyne to An Lairige by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/17250891356_13d107232b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Across Glen Fyne to An Lairige"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here my course finally intersected the guidebook route that comes up from Glen Fyne near the ruined cottage of Inverchorachan. Here there was a faint track and plenty of boot prints crossing the large snow patches that sat in front of the final low point before the slope began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17090799960" title="Beinn Bhuidhe&amp;#x27;s eastern wall by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7661/17090799960_7714d1664c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe&amp;#x27;s eastern wall"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17277857421" title="Looking up to the ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7688/17277857421_0d3e1d9291_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking up to the ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent to the ridge proved relatively straight forward. There was an easy angled snow slope and then a wet path up to a gully. The path was muddy but avoided any real difficulties. At the bottom of the gully there was a much larger snow patch, but by climbing up a steep, grass slope on the right I was able to soon rejoin the route after missing out the snow. After that there were no more difficulties and I was soon nearing the ridge. The views had opened out behind me as the Arrochar Hills appeared more fully, their tops clearing of the earlier cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was more snow at the ridgeline but again it was easy to bypass this once again and soon I was up, the views immediately opening up to the north-west where the whole of the Cruachan range of hills was strung out with Loch Awe visible to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17091538588" title="The upper part of the ascent gully by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8780/17091538588_a5aaaebb32_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The upper part of the ascent gully"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear path followed the eastern side of the ridge as it curved slowly up towards the summit. The morning was still young and bright and the views were excellent, though it was evident there was cloud and mist moving about. For a few minutes even the summit of Beinn Bhuidhe disappeared from sight but as I started the main pull up it reappeared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17093176829" title="The ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8756/17093176829_2e71953993_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the north now marched the long line of hills marking the Black Mount and behind me Ben Lui put in a brief appearance emerging from behind the shoulder of Beinn Bhuidhe's northern top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17278966171" title="The Central Highlands from Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8791/17278966171_23807407e6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Central Highlands from Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17253595886" title="Northern slopes of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8803/17253595886_197c23fab1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Northern slopes of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of me was the one thing I was worried about. At a narrowing of the ridge a decent snowpatch remained, its crest notched, with a steep plunge down the north side of the hill. A clear set of tracks climbed up it and next to them was the sign of someone who had glissaded down, their slide stopping alarmingly close to the drop off on the east. Ignoring the steep drop I slowly and carefully climbed up the steps, enlarging them where required. It was mostly fine but about three or four steps, four-fifths of the way up, felt particularly exposed. I was very glad when the gradient eased off and I found myself back on solid, grassy ground. Here there was a good view down onto Beinn Chas and the spot I had camped as well as north-east across the An Lairige reservoir where the mist was blowing in from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17277778322" title="Snow slope on the Beinn Bhuidhe ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7682/17277778322_8993e6c23b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Snow slope on the Beinn Bhuidhe ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path now wound its way up the final part of the ridge, avoiding any further snow and soon I was standing on the summit, a small cairn marking the top of this remote Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17253669486" title="West from the summit ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7685/17253669486_40d7c951b1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="West from the summit ridge of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17279176071" title="West to Loch Awe from Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7701/17279176071_a94ca3a1de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="West to Loch Awe from Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views were clear out west but behind to the east cloud had been gathering and was now being blown through on a chill wind. The views were briefly veiled but I took the opportunity to sit down, have a breather and some food and enjoy the solace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17279202011" title="Cloud coming over Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8703/17279202011_179bd9e254_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Cloud coming over Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes later the mist had blown through and it was looking much clearer. Cloud continued to worry some of the other peaks visible but I was back in the sunshine. The views from this remote peak are excellent with a vast swathe of the central Highlands visible from Cruachan across to Tyndrum and Crianlarich. These latter hills were largely lost in the mist and in the east Arrochar was visible only occasionally, one such glimpse giving me a dramatic sight of Ben Lomond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed on the summit in the sunshine for a good thirty or forty minutes, finding it hard to tear myself away from this sublime spot. Eventually though it became chilly enough that rather than dig into my bag for another layer, I decided to get moving, gathering up my things and leaving the summit behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17094419330" title="Mull and Loch Awe from Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8753/17094419330_da508c6590_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="Mull and Loch Awe from Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16659582584" title="Summit of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8703/16659582584_dc8a1023de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the top of the snow slope and readied myself to descend. A few slow steps down and suddenly a couple of guys and a whole pack of dogs appeared. I shouted down that they could come up if they wanted but they were happy for me to descend first, which I did, slowly, facing into the slope. The first few steps were the worst but it soon got easier and then I was saying hello to the pair who had camped down in Glen Fyne and made good time to get up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17282134035" title="Top of the snow slope on Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7721/17282134035_fd0590aced_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Top of the snow slope on Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I followed the enjoyable path back along the ridge and then, rather than heading down the gully, continued on until I was at the far end where the northern top rose up above the saddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17280378922" title="Crianlarich Hills and An Lairige by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7660/17280378922_6b65967f54_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Crianlarich Hills and An Lairige"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I briefly scouted the downward route which looked fine and then headed up the short, steep incline to the top. This summit is just below Munro height but nevertheless has fine views, especially back west to the main summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16659870194" title="Purple Saxifrage on Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7717/16659870194_6aca8cda34_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Purple Saxifrage on Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a few minutes up here looking out east to the Crianlarich Hills under wonderful cloud-streaked blue skies, to the Tyndrum hills with Ben Lui now attracting a more permanent cloud cap, and northwest across lonely Lochan Shira towards the Cruachan range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17282447065" title="Arrochar hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8750/17282447065_af12e59cec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arrochar hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this vantage point I could see the guys and their dogs making the return back down the upper slopes of Beinn Bhuidhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17095069960" title="The Beinn Bhuidhe ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8809/17095069960_01fa075885_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Beinn Bhuidhe ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking in my fill of the views I descended back down to the ridge and then started down the gently inclined slopes below the top, which angled their way back down to the bealach I had approached from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17282130391" title="The descent from Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7680/17282130391_1c1192c402_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The descent from Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16662419543" title="Below the east top of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8718/16662419543_67ef5fd283_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Below the east top of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made for a very easy descent, the slopes more gentle and the snow patches easily avoidable when required. I was soon picking my way down to the ugly new road which has been bulldozed through here from the bealach to the west. It was difficult to get down the very steep banks of the road cutting and I was glad to get across it and start descending the steep grass slopes into Glen Fyne.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent was slow going. There were only occasional traces of a path and the ground was steep and slippery in places. Over to the west I could see the better trodden path that comes up from Glen Fyne besides the Allt na Faing. This had a reputation for some interesting scrambling in parts which I didn't fancy discovering in descent. I spotted a couple of figures heading up the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17281051162" title="Falls on the descent of Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7694/17281051162_fcec8f098a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Falls on the descent of Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down things got easier as a faint track appeared. I crossed a rough pasture, passed a couple climbing up with their dogs and then dropped down the final grassy slopes to the ruins of Inverchorachan in Glen Fyne. By this point layers had been shed as the loss of height brought a marked increase in temperature. The day was perfect as blue skies stretched out overhead. There were excellent views up the rapidly narrowing Glen Fyne from here with the Munro of Beinn Dubhchraig dominating the view to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon reached the landrover track and followed it a short way down the glen until a way down to the river and a few warm rocks presented the ideal opportunity for lunch. Here I sat down, took off my shoes and socks, and soaked my feet in the cold, cold river water as it flowed quickly past. With the sun high it was blissful to stop here and eat food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17281349342" title="The River Fyne by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7705/17281349342_92fa841779_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The River Fyne"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this pleasant break I continued to follow the landrover track westward. The going was very easy and my pace picked up as I gradually returned to the more civilised parts of Glen Fyne. In the stretches of woodland bordering the river there were primroses and wood anemones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further down the glen there were houses and farms, people out in their gardens and sheep and cattle in the fields. Young lambs were sunning themselves by the side of the road, unwilling to move even when I stopped to take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17282136042" title="The River Fyne by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7678/17282136042_6930288ece_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The River Fyne"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the river and then followed the metalled road down the opposite side of the glen to which I had come the previous evening. There was a herd of Highland cattle to pick my way around carefully, keeping a way eye on the calves dotted amongst them, then I passed a chap out riding his bike and then I was coming round the corner to the pleasant location of the &lt;a href="http://www.fyneales.com/brewery-shop"&gt;Fyne Ales brewery&lt;/a&gt; at Achadunan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I not already had lunch this would have made a very pleasant stop but instead I took the opportunity to pick up a mixed box of ales, figuring the car was only a short walk away now. I carried this down the road, bordered by daffodils and crossed the river one final time just up from the loch to get me back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been an excellent trip, making the most of the long drive to this southwest corner of the Highlands. In the sunshine the drive back was long but enjoyable. I stopped off at Comrie Croft for afternoon tea and a scone and then scooted back up the A90, arriving back in Aberdeen just on 6pm and in time for a hearty fish supper washed down with a nice Black Cuillin purchased from the shop in Stonehaven a few days previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weekend had been in the diary for a while, fully expecting winter to be holding its steely grip on the mountains and for the views to be limited. Last September I’d accompanied Matt and Jenny on their first two Munros, those &lt;a href="/blog/2014/10/loch-lochy-munros/"&gt;above Loch Lochy&lt;/a&gt;, west of the Great Glen on a perfect autumn day with sunshine and bellowing stags. They’d been quite taken with the whole thing and were keen to get up to Scotland for another outing in the mountains. With their accomodation booked in Callander we’d agreed to do something in the southwest and after I sent Matt my list of unclimbed Munros he chose Beinn Chabhair as our target for the day. This is set back from Glen Falloch at the western end of the Crianlarich hills and based on likely conditions we chose to ascend it by the standard book route from the Drovers Inn besides the A82 on the west side of the hill. This would hopefully give a good path to follow and ensure we missed out any remnant snow patches on northern and eastern aspects which were still hanging on despite the widespread thaw and forecast mild temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met at Lochearnhead under a promising blue sky. It was already warming up nicely a little after 9am and following a quick drive around by Crianlarich we found the Drovers Inn car park filling up rapidly with walkers. After sorting out gear for the day and checking water supplies we were off, following the A82 a short way north before crossing the River Falloch and then detouring around the Ben Glas Farm campsite where people were up and about, airing out sleeping bags and enjoying breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17236867142" title="River Falloch by Beinn Glas Farm by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8773/17236867142_9e1d10a9a1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="River Falloch by Beinn Glas Farm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little bit of navigational uncertainty (entirely my fault) we found the route to the foot of the steep slope where a boggy, eroded path had us rapidly gaining height. The strong sunlight and lack of breeze made for a very hot and sweaty start and we were soon pausing to ditch most of our layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16618352023" title="Ben Vorlich across Glen Falloch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7726/16618352023_5b6b034cb6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Vorlich across Glen Falloch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made short work of the steep climb and found the going much easier as the gradient eased and started to contour around to where the Ben Glas Burn flows out of the high moorland west of the Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17050779438" title="Ben Vorlich and Glen Falloch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8759/17050779438_5b9548103b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Vorlich and Glen Falloch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a junction with a landrover track we caught up with a group of DofE-ers who seemed to be practicing river crossing techniques whilst wearing their big packs. It looked like hard work in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17031071047" title="River Crossing Practice by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/17031071047_9547e5fb73_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="River Crossing Practice"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previously unblemished blue skies were now playing host to a few fluffy white clouds which floated over the lumpy top of Meal Mor nan Eag to our left. As we progressed eastward, following the path which occassionaly disappeard in amongst bogs and marsh, the first view of Beinn Chabhair and its long ridge appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17237925171" title="Beinn Chabhair appears by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7628/17237925171_641871eb7f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Beinn Chabhair appears"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher up as we progressed towards the lochan the ground steepened and became less boggy. Here there were a couple of fun little scrambles as the pass weaved its way around and over crags and little side streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17050916640" title="Views of the Beinn Glas Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5453/17050916640_5b81ed51ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Views of the Beinn Glas Burn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17212464186" title="Ben Vorloch and the Beinn Glas Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7693/17212464186_0792291dab_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Vorloch and the Beinn Glas Burn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a pause besides one of these side streams for a snack break (and for someone to address their lack of caffeine). Feeling refreshed and with water bottle replenished with crisp, cold stream water, we were off again. Lochan Beinn Chabhair soon came into view and we were turning away from the course of the Ben Glas Burn and beginning the steep pull up to the ridge on the east side of Meall nan Tarmachan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17030971117" title="Lochan Ben Chabhair and Parlan Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8733/17030971117_0bba9cbbe9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochan Ben Chabhair and Parlan Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path made easy work of the grassy slope, gaining us height quickly with the views starting to open out over the blue waters of the lochan to Parlan Hill and Ben Vorlich in the Arrochar group off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep gradient eased as we came up to the eastern shoulder of Meall nan Tarmachan. Here we paused to take in the wonderful views as we started to get a view of Loch Long. The summit of Beinn Chabhair still towered above us to the east but we were definitely making progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17212385516" title="View back down the Ben Glas Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7629/17212385516_e75e03fa51_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="View back down the Ben Glas Burn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path now winds its way up and down and around the complex terrain marking the bealach between Tarmachan and Beinn Chabhair. There was a bit of height loss and a snow patch or two to circumvent but we were soon at the start of the Beinn Chabhair ridge looking across the wide glen towards An Caisteal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17237681801" title="An Caisteal from the Beinn Chabhair bealach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7604/17237681801_38d6552619_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="An Caisteal from the Beinn Chabhair bealach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some spectacular views north towards Glen Falloch and the hills around the Bridge of Orchy and Glen Lyon. As we rose on the northwest ridge of Beinn Chabhair the Tyndrum Hills dominated by Beinn Lui also made an appearance. In the distance we could just discern the flat back of Ben Nevis rising between a gap in the Mamores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17050685200" title="The northwest ridge of Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7710/17050685200_b8becb76e5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The northwest ridge of Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path up the ridge, though steep and eroded in places, is a good one, and again we seemed to be gaining height without too many problems. The sun was shining and we’d left behind a group of people who we had caught up to at the bealach. The views were really spectacular now as we could see all the way out west towards the Cruachan group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17030732007" title="Meall nan Tarmachan and the Southwest Highlands by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7607/17030732007_d574bcab24_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall nan Tarmachan and the Southwest Highlands"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the southwest there was now a better view down Loch Long and Ben Lomond was a dark tall point further south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617929523" title="Loch Long and Arrochar Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7699/16617929523_0338740176_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Long and Arrochar Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a few craggy sections which the path picked its way around and then a final snow patch before the ridge was levelling out and we emerged on the northwest end, looking off to the actual summit some way to the southeast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17030664987" title="Arrochar and Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8734/17030664987_634a888e56_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Arrochar and Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path dipped and swooped its way along the delightful broad ridge to the summit and then we were climbing up to the cairn where we celebrated our arrival with a few photographs and then a sit down for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17050220198" title="Summit of Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/17050220198_db7827ebd2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Summit of Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views were glorious in all directions and as we sat, slowly more and more people arrived until there were quite a few people dotted around the summit area enjoying the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617751043" title="West from Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5444/16617751043_beb4083dda_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="West from Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling refreshed we had a very brief discussion about routes and decided to head back the way we had come rather than following the ridge round and descending down towards Parlan Hill. The busy summit area was soon left behind and we retraced our steps back down towards the bealach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617721783" title="Looking back to Beinn Chabhair&amp;#x27;s summit by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/16617721783_fb35ae6c62_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking back to Beinn Chabhair&amp;#x27;s summit"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost height quickly, the weather holding well and the views equally as good as they had been on the way up. Soon we were at the bealach looking back up at the tiny figures up on the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617673493" title="Summit of Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7663/16617673493_d98ba8188e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a good view of Beinn Bhuidhe, my target for the Sunday, which appeared to be largely snow free, even on this eastern side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617633183" title="Beinn Bhuidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8797/16617633183_137988de85_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Beinn Bhuidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a snow patch to cross and then we were winding our way below Meall nan Tarmachan to start the final steep descent back down to the Ben Glas Burn just downstream of Lochan Beinn Chabhair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16617618603" title="West from Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/16617618603_75ebd9650f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="West from Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was a simple case of following our outward route, avoiding the worst of the bogs encountered earlier and enjoying the views back to Beinn Chabhair which quickly receded behind us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17211773816" title="Ben Glas Burn and Beinn Chabhair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7668/17211773816_9669678223_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Glas Burn and Beinn Chabhair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Drovers Inn came into view as we reached the lip of Glen Falloch and all that remained was the steep slope down past the impressive series of waterfalls where we started to encounter a few tourists exploring the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17211720466" title="Tyndrum Hills from above Glen Falloch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7632/17211720466_8d958d4797_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Tyndrum Hills from above Glen Falloch"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We descended back down to the campsite where we found it much busier with tents being set up and a pair of lambs resting in the cool shade away from the hustle and bustle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/17237066261" title="Ben Glas Falls by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7637/17237066261_aa7b8d3608_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Glas Falls"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the cars we retired to the Drovers Inn for cold drinks and a chat in the sunshine, reflecting back on an excellent day in perfect weather.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="crianlarich"></category><category term="lomond"></category><category term="inverarnan"></category></entry><entry><title>The Loch Lochy Munros</title><link href="https://tms.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2014/09/loch-lochy-munros/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-29T17:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-09-29T17:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.invertedworld.co.uk,2014-09-29:/blog/2014/09/loch-lochy-munros/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following the standard bagging route from Kilfinnan in the Great Glen on a glorious, sunny autumn day .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 29th September 2014&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 18.57km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,230m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Meall na Teanga (Munro), Sron a' Choire Ghairbh (Munro)            &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Early mist clearing to give plenty of sunshine               &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/416"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a happy bunch of people who assembled at the unofficial parking area near Kilfinnan Farm in the heart of the Great Glen. For Matt, Jenny and Brian this was to be their first outing in the Scottish hills. The day promised to be good, autumn sunshine spilling from behind clouds and mist clearing all but the highest tops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15251934840" title="The forest road above Loch Lochy by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5598/15251934840_0bb9d355e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The forest road above Loch Lochy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15251865789" title="Loch Lochy from Kilfinnan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3936/15251865789_4425123150_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Lochy from Kilfinnan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk in on the forest road above Loch Lochy was a pleasant way of warming up and we covered the ground quickly. The leaders were chattering away to such an extent that they missed the narrow path, marked by a cairn, that led west away from the road and up into the trees. This took us up through pines and then birchwood with the Allt Glas-Dhoire tumbling away in a hidden gorge to our left. Sunlight filtered down through the trees and it was wonderfully pleasant, the smells of autumn all around and toadstools scattered here and there amongst the mossy undergrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15438702055" title="Falls below the path by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/15438702055_d70f8d740f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Falls below the path"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher up we emerged above the treeline into the narrow glen below the Cam Bhealach. The track was flanked by bronzed bracken and zig-zagged steeply up the slope before starting to level off as we climbed up into the coire. There were beautiful views back down to Loch Lochy and the last of the summer's purple heather hung on in places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way up through the Cam Bhealach heading for the saddle at the top which separates the two hills. Above us the mist slowly cleared away from the crags until we had clear views up to the tops above us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15438816325" title="Up towards the Cam Bhealach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3927/15438816325_7e9664f3b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Up towards the Cam Bhealach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path was mostly good and only got a little boggy as we reached the crest of the bealach. A chill wind was blowing in from the west and so we took a break in the lee of a few rocks, eating a few snacks and deciding which of the two Munros we would be heading for first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15438588592" title="Meall Dubh from the Cam Bhealach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3929/15438588592_c4e352bdf2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall Dubh from the Cam Bhealach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a decision made we decided to head for Meall na Teanga first, and so from the top of the pass we crossed the boggy watershed and then headed up the narrow but clear track leading us south. The views immediately started to open up westward across Meall an Tagraidh towards the glens that lead into the Rough Bounds of Knoydart. Blue sky appeared though the odd patch of cloud and mist did keep descending down onto the hills immediately around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15252249409" title="Meall an Tagraidh above the Allt Cam Bhealaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5600/15252249409_b75b153b65_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall an Tagraidh above the Allt Cam Bhealaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path climbed the lower slopes of Meall Odhar and then traversed around on a boggy course to the col below Meall na Teanga. Its curved spine was presented to us as we came around the corner and continued our way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15438689332" title="First view of Meall na Teanga by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2943/15438689332_74eab72d46_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="First view of Meall na Teanga"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we pulled up from the bealach on a steeper but drier path there were great views back down to Loch Lochy far below. Above us the cloud was once more gathering and seemed to be dropping in height. The day grew a little greyer but we continued stoicly, hopeful of another lifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15252395360" title="Loch Lochy by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5598/15252395360_5af62055d9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Lochy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were now good views back across the Cam Bhealach to Sron a' Choire Ghairbh, which would be the day's second Munro a little later on. it was very autumnal and there was the occassional bellow of a stag in heat from somewhere in the glens below us. From time to time we would see a glimpse of deer running across slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15252505228" title="Northwest from Meall na Teanga by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3934/15252505228_b05eebfc59_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Northwest from Meall na Teanga"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After clibming the broadsouthern ridge we emerged on the plateau which gave an easy walk along to the summit cairn with fine views down to Loch Lochy, tiny cars and trucks heading along the A82 their engines just the faintest roar on the edge of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15416100326" title="Summit plateau of Meall na Teanga by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5601/15416100326_63a49c3e8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit plateau of Meall na Teanga"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially it seemed like the views were going to disappear as the cloud moved in but after a short wait at the cairn it became apparent that it was breaking again and by the time we'd had a spot of lunch the sun was back out. In the distance we could see Ben Nevis towering over the Great Glen, to the west the mountains of the North West Highlands were bathed in sunshine whilst cotton-wool clouds were wrapped over the Monadhliath hills to the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the weather much improved it was with a spring in our steps that we retraced our outward steps, back along the plateau and down the ridge to the bealach below. The loose and scrabbly path gave the occassaional pause for thought but soon enough we were all back at the Cam Bhealaich and looking up at the zig-zag stalker's path that would give a much quicker ascent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path quickly gained us height and we enjoyed the fine views to the west. The light was very different from the morning, throwing into sharp relief all the texture and grain in the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15252843400" title="Meall na Teanga by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5599/15252843400_dc1dfb81f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall na Teanga"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We soon enough reached the top of the zig-zags where a short climb up a grassy slope led to the lip of the great eastern coire of Sron a' Choire Ghairbh. Here it was blustery but the views were incredible and we could see all the way up to Loch Ness and spot where our accommodation for the week was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was just a short stroll up a grassy slope to the summit plateau where the cairn came into view, along with amazing panoramic views into the North West Highlands with views to Glen Garry and Loch Quoich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15436511311" title="Afternoon sunshine on Sron a&amp;#x27;Choire Ghairbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3932/15436511311_6777fc1163_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Afternoon sunshine on Sron a&amp;#x27;Choire Ghairbh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was breathtaking and although a chilly wind was blowing, in the shelter of the cairn under a blue sky it was really quite pleasant. We had a snack break and everyone sat around enjoying the peace and stillness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15253129618" title="Sron a&amp;#x27;Choire Ghairbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5600/15253129618_15d54e1369_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="Sron a&amp;#x27;Choire Ghairbh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit it was a straightforward route back, retracing our steps down to the zig-zags and then down to the bealach. We soon warmed up again in the bright afternoon sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a regroup at the bealach we headed down the path, the lengthening shadows giving the glen a quite different character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was a very pleasant walk down with lovely views around and before too long we were descending down through the trees to the forest road above Loch Lochy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another regroup and then we headed back along to the car waiting at Kilfinnan chatting away and enjoying the warmth amongst the trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short drive back, dropping Blake off to catch the bus back to Inverness, and we were back at the House where cocktails and croquet were already in full swing. It had been a wonderful day in great company.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="autumn"></category><category term="lochy"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="munros"></category><category term="scotland"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ben Starav Group</title><link href="https://tms.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2014/06/ben-starav/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-29T18:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-06-29T18:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.invertedworld.co.uk,2014-06-29:/blog/2014/06/ben-starav/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overnight backpacking trip taking in the five Munros of the Ben Starav group in the West Highlands of Scotland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday 28th June&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victoria Bridge to Wild Camp on Ben Starav (NN 126 425)&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 23.7km&lt;br&gt;
Elevation: 1,550m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Beinn nan Aighenan (Munro: 933m), Ben Starav (Munro: 1,078m)  &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/421"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled out of Tyndrum, rounding the sharp left hand bend in the road that climbs up into a narrow glen where the road, the railway and the West Highland Way all squeeze together. I noticed the Caledonian Sleeper pulling up the grade just beside me. Sadly all 3,200bhp of the Class 67 hauling it weren’t a match for the 74bhp of my Fiesta, zipping along with just me and my lightweight camping pack. An early getaway from Aberdeen had brought with it the reward of mostly quiet roads and I tootled past the waking campers, stretching and blinking in the bright morning sun, on the flats near the Inveroran Hotel just after 8am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car park at Victoria Bridge was empty apart from a couple of other early arrivals and the obligatory sleepy campervan. The presence, in this shady, sheltered spot below the pines, of a few midgies meant no-one was hanging around for a chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667280096" title="Loch Tulla and the Bridge of Orchy Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5565/14667280096_39becd31d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Loch Tulla and the Bridge of Orchy Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14687123701" title="The Black Mount from Victoria Bridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5559/14687123701_9c29ce86c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="575" alt="The Black Mount from Victoria Bridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a hurried croissant, the final dregs of a service station coffee and a final bag check I myself was off, walking past the buildings at Forest Lodge and then slowing down a bit as I escaped the midges and reached the open glen alongside the Abhainn Shira. Quite clearly it has been dry over on the west in recent weeks and the river levels were low. Ahead of me was a glorious panorama of hills, several of which were on my high level route planned to fill the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503867237" title="Toward Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3881/14503867237_040da97c7c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Toward Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, under a warm sun, it was an easy walk down the glen, following the broad vehicle track. The weather was perfect and I made good progress. As the track bent away from the river towards the house at Clashgour a sign pointed me onto a delightful stretch of narrow footpath that closely followed the river bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667308226" title="The Road Less Travelled by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14667308226_75c6bef19e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Road Less Travelled"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was much easier on the feet and provided plenty of occasions to stop and enjoy nature. Large dragonflies chuck-chucked out of the long grass ahead of me. A fish jumping rippled the lazy almost dead still river. Birds flitted through the tussocks and heather. It was a wonderful detox after a week in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14687158161" title="By the Abhainn Shira by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5489/14687158161_e0ee7f7167_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="By the Abhainn Shira"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Allt Clashgour a sign informed me of the missing bridge. With low water levels though it was easy to cross on dry rocks and then there was a choice - footpath or vehicle track. I chose the former which turned into a boggy tramp through a plantation until I dropped down towards the bouncy bridge across the Abhainn Shira. Here I stopped for a quick chat to a guy who had spent two nights camped by Loch Dochard, bagging the surrounding peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503698479" title="Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5587/14503698479_24409c1840_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loch Dochard itself was my next stop, reached by a landrover track which paralleled the river as it tumbled down from the body of water in a series of pleasant falls. A shower passed along the far side of the glen and over Stob Ghabhar, shrouding its dark flanks. I hardly got wet at all but was treated to a stunning rainbow sitting low beyond the next rise in the glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14570263245" title="Glen Dochard Rainbow by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/14570263245_98763a56de_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Dochard Rainbow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503685440" title="The hills around Coire Chaorach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3849/14503685440_e512db3716_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The hills around Coire Chaorach"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idyllic waters of Loch Dochard came into view and I dropped down from the track for a sit by the shore. A couple of folk were cleaning pots and packing up their tent a little further round the shoreline. The panorama of peaks was spectacular and I sat taking it all in whilst fending off the annoyances of some pesky black flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667359766" title="Loch Dochard by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3885/14667359766_73da35b721_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Dochard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My amble up the glen continued after the break. The skies grew a bit gloomier as I crossed the watershed, approaching the impressively steep flanks of  Beinn nan Aighenan with the infant waters of the Kinglass beginning to co-mingle. The lonely Lochan na h-Iuraiche looked very appealing below the dark crags of Meall nan Eun, a quiet spot away from the crowds at Loch Dochard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503959207" title="Ben Starav hills above Lochan na h-Iuraiche by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2914/14503959207_834625b417_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Starav hills above Lochan na h-Iuraiche"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503761368" title="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich above Lochan na h-Iuraiche by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5594/14503761368_cdd991a1f6_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich above Lochan na h-Iuraiche"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14687234601" title="Looking back to Loch Dochard by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14687234601_6cfc4772fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking back to Loch Dochard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503981607" title="The track to Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14503981607_274d0d0ff7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The track to Glen Kinglass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the feeders into the Kinglass which were again shallow and picked up the track that runs down the north bank of the river under the slopes of Beinn nan Aighenan. I’d considered this as a possible ascent route but had decided to head up besides the Allt Hallater, further to the west, which looked like it might offer a more accessible slope and an easier route to the top of the hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503760550" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14503760550_3b2b5a3dcc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Kinglass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667435456" title="Falls on the River Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3924/14667435456_df6e701bf0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Falls on the River Kinglass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant walking further down Glen Kinglass which was very pleasant. I had a break by the long section of falls which were a little unspectacular with the low water levels and then pushed on, passing the farm at Glen Kinglass House and then dropping down to where the Allt Hallater came in from the slopes below Beinn na Luss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14710341773" title="Glenkinglass Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3922/14710341773_f1ae76909d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Glenkinglass Lodge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14688079344" title="Blue skies above Coire Hallater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3864/14688079344_5093c97751_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Blue skies above Coire Hallater"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I searched around for the start of the path marked on the OS map but came up short, finding only lumpy ground and bracken growing high on the sunny side of the glen. I fought my way up through this a short distance away from the bank of the stream, eventually emerging higher up where I stumbled, annoyingly, on the path. Looking back I could see its vague course uphill and to the left of the bracken. Ho hum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14504028627" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14504028627_9054375c86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Kinglass"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the path for a brief way before leaving it to cross boggy ground up to the steep slope that climbs besides the Eas an Eich Bhain. The path itself continues up into Coire Hallater and would, with hindsight, probably offer the best way to climb this steep sided mountain. Instead I carefully picked my way up the incredibly steep slope, sticking where possible to terraced grass and winding my way around crags and rocks. The slope was steep and didn’t ease for a good four or five hundred metres with Glen Kinglass opening up below my feet and the views across Ben Luss to Ben Cruachan improving rapidly with each step upward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503828989" title="Ben Cruachan beyond Beinn nan Lus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5593/14503828989_965791dbfb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Cruachan beyond Beinn nan Lus"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14688097844" title="Towards Ben Cruachan from Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14688097844_077e114f55_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Towards Ben Cruachan from Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503832209" title="Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5569/14503832209_cd63251c22_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, thankfully, the crazy slope eased and I emerged into a jumbled land of rock and pools and grass that sits to the south of the the main summit. Although not quite as striaght forward as on the map I was able to pick my way around to the south ridge and followed this up to the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14690212102" title="Loch Etive from Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5567/14690212102_b8f62fff76_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Loch Etive from Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the patchy sunshine of Glen Kinglass I’d been plunged into a brooding and overcast day. Cloud was now wreathing Ben Starav although it seemed like the lower summits were avoiding the worst of it. Below me the silver surface of Loch Etive wound its way around towards the sea somewhere in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503864648" title="Loch Etive and Coire Hallater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5570/14503864648_530262b3c5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Etive and Coire Hallater"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I emerged at the summit cairn a drizzle started. It wasn’t enough to dampen my spirits though which had been lifted by obtaining this first summit of the trip. Shortly after I arrived a chap and his dog also made it to the top and we both sat either side of the cairn munching on our sandwiches whilst we watched the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14503853060" title="Summit of Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14503853060_cd92d1993b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With rain falling and the views closing in I thought it sensible to make a move, now picking up the very clear track that heads down towards the bealach separating Beinn nan Aighenan from the main Ben Starav group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14690261222" title="Ben Starav from Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3924/14690261222_030e68c411_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Starav from Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I started with my hood down the rain soon fizzled out and things improved slightly as the cloud started clearing from Ben Starav itself. With a good track it was a relatively easy descent though I was caught by the chap from the summit who hopped his way down the steeper sections. We proceeded to chat over the rest of the descent and it was only when the track rose up from the bealach that I left him behind again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track climbed easily up to the bealach between the east top of Ben Starav and the ridge leading along to Glas Bheinn Mhor. With the prospects of a view from Ben Starav now looking much more likely I turned left and started to work my way up its eastern ridge. To the north now I had a view down to Glen Etive and across to the hills that border Glencoe. There were patches of sunlight appearing and the day looked promising once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14690588705" title="Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14690588705_cc0bfc048f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial climb from the bealach was easy enough and I soon had views back across to Beinn nan Aighenan and east along the chain of hills that would be my route back towards the car eventually. The slope narrowed to a ridge which took me high above the shattered northern slopes of Ben Starav's eastern top which featured some interesting geology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667586296" title="Beinn nan Aighenan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2916/14667586296_72cf9d139b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Beinn nan Aighenan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The east top was rocky but enjoyed views along the narrowest section of the ridge and up towards the summit itself. I watched a couple of people bypass the pinnacles before setting off myself to see what the ridge was like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tackled the first pinnacle but took the bypass path for the remainder, my scrambling feeling a little rusty. The narrow ridge climbed up and it was a very eroded path that got my finally up to the summit plateau of Ben Starav.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was an easy stroll under a brightening sky around the rim of the mountain's north-eastern coire to reach the rocky summit where I put my pack down and took in the magnificent panorama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away to the south stretched Loch Etive with the distinctive notched peaks of the Ben Cruachan range in the distance. Out beyond Loch Linnhe stood Mull, given away by the distinctive sight of Ben More.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667647216" title="Loch Etive from Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5572/14667647216_cc5813854d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Etive from Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the east sunlight was catching the hills above the Bridge of Orchy whilst dark clouds still hung over the Black Mount as the clouds and showers of the afternoon moved off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14504027569" title="Bridge of Orchy hills from Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/14504027569_34dcf79540_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bridge of Orchy hills from Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a good half an hour or so just sitting on the summit, watching as the light changed and the day warmed up again. Eventually I checked the time and was surprised to find it was already late in the afternoon. I looked back east, picking out the rise and fall in the hills and wandering how much further it would be until I got to a decent camping spot. I was doubtful any spot could rival the view I was currently enjoying from Ben Starav and despite my initial plan to camp further east, possibly beyond the next Munro, I pretty soon came to a decision that I would be camping up here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way across the plateau to the summit I'd notcied a fine grassy bowl and so I headed down to see whether it would suit. It was pretty obvious on inspection that it was an excellent spot, with grand views, nearby water (though not running) and a soft, grassy pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14690690375" title="Wild camping on Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3888/14690690375_74fc1b3db2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Wild camping on Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed a thoroughly perfect evening, brewing up for a cuppa and lounging about in the sunshine with views down to Loch Etive and along to Ben Cruachan. I reflected on the fact that I had camped just on the shoulder of that fine range of hills twelve months previous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a cuppa and then soup, a bit more relaxing and it was time for some dinner. This was my first time trying out one of the meals from &lt;a href="http://www.mountaintrails.org.uk"&gt;Mountain Trails&lt;/a&gt; who I'd found after a couple of people mentioned using them on the TGO Challenge this year. I went for the minced beef and mashed potato which comes in two separate pouches. I was slightly skeptical of this approach, and though it turned out the meal did require a lot of boiling water (just about 600ml) it was very tasty and had the texture of perfectly normal food. It was a filling dinner and overall I was impressed with the quality of the meal despite the additional waste packaging/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14688349734" title="Showers over the Black Mount by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3877/14688349734_0233d4586b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Showers over the Black Mount"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667732256" title="Late sunshine over Mull by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14667732256_377d438195_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Late sunshine over Mull"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner I decided to head back up to the summit and have a general wander about the mountain. I was half thinking I might head out to the southern tops as these looked to be interesting spurs with long ridge lines heading down towards Loch Etive. However, after looking at the sunlit Glencoe hills and clambering back up to the summit itself I spotted that a second tent had appeared on the hill. I thought it would be slightly rude not to say hello so popped over to where they were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were a pair from Edinburgh who’d camped close to the summit of Stob Ghabhar the previous night and made their way along the range of hills to Ben Starav during the day. They were having some interesting problems with their liquid fuelled stove which caused some scary moments considering how close the tent fabric was to the naked flames. Eventually they got it going and started to cook up a tasty looking pasta dinner with lots of fresh ingredients. We chatted away about the pleasures of summit camping and then, as they were about to have dinner, agreed to meet up on the summit to watch the sunset, still a couple of hours away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14687572791" title="Rainbow over the Black Mount by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3915/14687572791_bfde18caf9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rainbow over the Black Mount"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wandered back towards my tent I noticed a beautiful rainbow had appeared over the hills towards Stob Ghabhar, stretching between dramatic clouds and the dark hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14504077710" title="Sunshine in Glen Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/14504077710_b942b2b3ea_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sunshine in Glen Etive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back outside the tent I grabbed my phone and headphones and found a comfortable set of boulders to recline back against and listened to music as I watched the evening light flow over Loch Etive and the surrounding hills. It was sublime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 9:30 I put on an extra warm layer, made myself a cup of hot chocolate and headed up towards the summit for a view of sunset. My neighbours from the other tent joined me a few moments later and we stood and sat around the summit cairn watching as the most beautiful, subtle sunset unfolded out in the west towards Mull and Jura. It had that fiery intensity you only really get on the west coast but it was the more pastel shades that stretched out on either side that really took your breath away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun eventually dipped somewhere beyond the hills of Jura and the temperature, already low, rapidly dropped. The show was over and it was time to head back down to cosy sleeping bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14667827926" title="Last light on Ben Cruachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3852/14667827926_d751660c5d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Last light on Ben Cruachan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The colour faded from the sky rapidly and by the time I was back at the tent it was a rather grey world. The prospects of noctilucent clouds seemed slim and indeed by the time I was zipped up in my sleeping bag, my wooly hat on, there was a pattering of rain on the tent. After a couple of chapters of my book I drifted off to sleep...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sunday 29th June&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking the time of sunrise the previous evening I’d set my alarm for a few minutes before it and woke to a cold but mostly cloudless pre-dawn. All my layers went back on and I stepped out into the world. Cloud hung around the peaks further east and north but above me it was almost completely clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14582925220" title="First light on Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5590/14582925220_d07c2ee169_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="First light on Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14383574238" title="Ben Starav at dawn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14383574238_d1a9472116_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Starav at dawn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way slowly and stiffly up to the lip of the north eastern coire, just in time to watch the sun crest the distant hills. The light was fantastic and as the first light of dawn lit up Ben Starav I clambered up the path to the summit cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14746656176" title="Shadow of Ben Starav on Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3871/14746656176_5b6b4a276a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Shadow of Ben Starav on Loch Etive"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sunrise equalled the sunset of the previous evening, this time a little bit more special for having it all to myself. I watched in wonder as the light spread across the hilltops, the shadow of Ben Starav stretching out over Loch Etive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying the show for a good twenty or so minutes the best part was over and I headed back down to the tent to get back into my lovely warm sleeping bag and another couple of hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14746724276" title="West from Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14746724276_2214e0fa86_b.jpg" width="1024" height="684" alt="West from Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually woke up around 7:30 as the heat in the tent began to build. It felt good to get up and get a coffee on, munching away on a breakfast bar as steam rose in great plumes from the stove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 8:30 I was packed up and set off eastward, stopping by the pool to refresh my water supply and say goodbye to my fellow campers who were just starting breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14789683393" title="Cloud reflections by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3919/14789683393_28438a6150_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloud reflections"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set off to the start of the east ridge, retreading the route I had taken to get up Ben Starav the previous afternoon. The views along the range of hills were superb as light and shadow played over them and the glen far below. The scrabbly eroded descent woke up whatever the coffee had missed and I was soon at the start of the narrow section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge was a delight in the morning sunshine and I kept to the crest for most of its length, only using the bypass path to skip one awkwardly angled pinnacle near the eastern top. I paused often to revel in the solitude and splendour of this spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14769539552" title="On the east ridge of Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5557/14769539552_af01013087_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="On the east ridge of Ben Starav"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the east top there were excellent views back along the ridge and over to Ben Cruachan. The long north ridge of Ben Starav, the route typically climbed if coming up from Glen Etive, was perfectly illuminated by the morning sun. Soon I was making my way down the rocky path, past the fractures, intrusions and pinnacles and looking forward to the first new Munro of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather had changed a little as I descended the slopes back to the bealach from which I had started the climb the previous afternoon. Cloud had moved in and now the skies were grey and looking a little moody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14583260969" title="Towards Glas Bheinn Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2919/14583260969_ee16d44b8d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Glas Bheinn Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the bealach I started the easy ascent of Meall nan Tri Tighearnan and was soon enjoying the views back up to Ben Starav and along the undulating ridge which led the eye eastward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14746908846" title="Ben Starav from Meall nan Tri Tighearnan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5559/14746908846_8b9a8ac980_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Ben Starav from Meall nan Tri Tighearnan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this minor top there were good views down Corie nan Camh owards Loch Dochard and the Bridge of Orchy hills, as well as across to Beinn nan Aighenan which I had climbed the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14583291938" title="Bridge of Orchy Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2911/14583291938_392e601205_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Bridge of Orchy Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued on, dropping down to the next bealach and then making the rather gentle ascent of Glas Bheinn Mhor, the next Munro along the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reached the summit cairn the grey cloud started to break and once again I was in sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were now clear views north beyond Glencoe to the Mamores and Ben Nevis, a seemingly endless stretch of mountains fading out into darker skies to the northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14768244721" title="The Mamores and Nevis from Glas Bheinn Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3909/14768244721_ff1e94847e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Mamores and Nevis from Glas Bheinn Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a clear track down the east ridge of Glas Bheinn Mhor, heading for the next low bealach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is truly delightful walking country, the narrow ridges giving a feeling of loftiness, but the terrain easy and the way always clear. I particularly enjoyed looking down the length of the glen which I had walked up the previous morning, ticking off features and landmarks as I passed them from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path dropped quickly down to the bealach with a couple of rocky sections to negotiate before I was down and glad to find a tinkling stream just below the high point of the col. I took the opportunity to refill my water bottle and take a long, thirst quenching drink. The only problem with the dry weather was how dry the ridge and bealachs themselves were. This was the first accessible running water I'd seen since leaving Glen Kinglass the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14777191754" title="Descent to the bealach below Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3853/14777191754_26e076f174_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Descent to the bealach below Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climb up from the bealach to Stob Coir’an Albannaich was short but steep, bringing me out onto a verdant, grassy sloping plateau with the main summit still a little way to the east. Rather than tackle the side of this direct I followed the plateau north up the easy slope to where the mountain’s west ridge led me up towards the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14592854380" title="Glas Bheinn Mhor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5585/14592854380_07e76e3549_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glas Bheinn Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging on the summit plateau which encircles the grand northeastern coire I decided first to go to the western end to catch the excellent views down towards Glen Etive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14799461803" title="Minor western top of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5579/14799461803_8770cdb45d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Minor western top of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this brief diversion I made my way back along the summit ridge to the main summit passing some equisitie displays of high mountain wildflowers in full blooom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit is an airy perch, a grassy cairn offering a comfortable spot to admire the big views from this lofty summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14592927600" title="Summit of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14592927600_2e7b36cd5e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a snack and, looking to the east, was glad to see that Stob Ghabhar was now looking a little closer. Before reaching it though I still had one final new Munro to cross and a fairly hefty reascent to get up onto the final ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14779670625" title="Meall nan Eun from Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/14779670625_c73408a622_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall nan Eun from Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent from Albannaich was initially steep and narrow down a well defined ridge. Eventually though the slope eased and the ridge broadened. The cairn marking the point of descent is well documented online and in guides and I found it without problem, following a faint track down a steep sloping gully towards the bealach below. I lost the track lower down but emerged unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593042008" title="East ridge of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14593042008_72499e32a1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="East ridge of Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jumbled bealach offered some fine views up the dramatic, stony northeast side of Albannaich. It was a very different landscape to the grassy ridges which I had been traversing up until now. A few pools hidden amongst the rocks showed the potential this area has for wild camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14779741275" title="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2937/14779741275_4f272156a3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the rocky bealach a faint trail led me up the gentle slopes of Meall Tarsuinn where I met the first other person of the day, coming in the opposite direction. They were on a decent hike, heading for Ben Starav and then on to Cruachan before catching the train back to Glasgow. The summit of Meall Tarsuinn came quickly and there were splendid views back to the twin-summited Stob Coir' an Albannaich with the sun coming back out over the Glencoe hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The far side of Meall Tarsuinn was more jumbled rock and boulders but I was soon at the bealach and beginning the climb up to Meall na Eun, the third Munro of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593135308" title="Loch Dochard by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3895/14593135308_595ec7b184_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Dochard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I was up the easy angled slopes on a good path and at the Munro summit, a large, flat and mostly featureless plateau with Stob Ghabhar looming in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant lunch and aware that time was marching on with at least one more big ascent to tackle I was soon off, heading west along the plateau to pick out the vague northwest ridge which would lead me down to the final bealach of the trip. The descent was steep and slithery on grass slopes interspersed by boulders and crags. Routefinding was a challenge and I had to backtrack or traverse on a couple of occassions to find a secure way down. Eventually I scrambled down a slithery rock gully and emerged at the bealach with the huge wall of Meall Odhar ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the bealach brought me under these steep slopes. In his &lt;a href="http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2012/the-high-level-route-for-midges/"&gt;report of these hills&lt;/a&gt; Mark Horrel says of this particular hillside&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one of those slopes you look back at and wonder how you got down. You certainly wouldn’t be tempted to climb up it if you were coming the other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well here I was, and if I wanted to get to Stob Ghabhar I would be going up it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14779851435" title="Stob a&amp;#x27;Bhruaich Leith ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3908/14779851435_7bd2bfe26b_b.jpg" alt="Stob a&amp;#x27;Bhruaich Leith ridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit of a calf-screaming ascent, but not really any worse than that pull out of Glen Kinglass the day before. In fact the footing was securer and the ascent seemed to be shorter and soon enough I had grandstand views back across the bealach towards Albannaich and over to Meall nan Eun, &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; slopes now looking impossibly steep and craggy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14777502884" title="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14777502884_3a466ec0cf_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Coir&amp;#x27;an Albannaich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was now up on the final ridge that would lead me towards Stob Ghabhar. A small cairn marked the summit of Meall Odhar which enjoyed fine views east towards the Black Mount and into Glencoe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593232668" title="Summit of Meall Odhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3882/14593232668_967fb46d41_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Meall Odhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long ridge which extends over a couple of subsidiary tops before climbing up to the summit of Stob Ghabhar is a joy, delightful high level walking on mostly dry ground with stunning views in all directions. With the last big ascent done I was able to make good progress and delighted in stretching my legs on this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593186880" title="The ridge to Stob a&amp;#x27;Bhruaich Leith by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14593186880_9e959e15b0_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The ridge to Stob a&amp;#x27;Bhruaich Leith"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I covered ground quickly and was soon looking past the craggy eastern end of Meall nan Eun down to Loch Dochard which I’d been sitting besides just the previous morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593407857" title="Loch Dochard and Ben Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3868/14593407857_f340b9b77d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Dochard and Ben Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593419937" title="The long ridge to Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14593419937_28906df1b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The long ridge to Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of me the ridge stretched away, rising to the first minor top of Stob a'Bhruaich Leith which had grand views across to Glencoe and back to Meall nan Eun and Stob Coir’ an Albainnaich beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14799789583" title="Glen Etive and Glencoe Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14799789583_7317065a82_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Glen Etive and Glencoe Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route now curved around the high cliffs of Coire Laoghan with views across to the long ridges which mark the hills between here and the Black Mount proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14799809443" title="Above Coire Laoghan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5555/14799809443_9fd912d18f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Above Coire Laoghan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Munro top of Sron a'Ghearrain the final slopes up to Stob Ghabhar were revealed. Rather than make my way directly up their western side I elected to traverse around to the north and pick up the track I knew came down from the summit. This should offer views into the Coire Lochain and make the final ascent a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14756982226" title="Stob Ghabhar from the west by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3850/14756982226_2065a7a040_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Ghabhar from the west"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14777627584" title="Towards Clashgour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14777627584_c2c23f570c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Clashgour"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked my way around the head of Coire a’ Chaolain with views down to Clashgour and the woods near the Abhainn Shira and then climbed up to the col below Stob Ghabhar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593497247" title="Coire a&amp;#x27; Chaolain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2918/14593497247_6d0179fba9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Coire a&amp;#x27; Chaolain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from here were spectacular with the drama of Coire Lochain below my feet leading the eye out towards the watery expanse of Rannoch Moor. Above me and not far away now was the final summit of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593385198" title="Rannoch Moor from Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5552/14593385198_072217a7f2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rannoch Moor from Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A path, taken by those undertaking the Clachlet Traverse, took me easily up the final bouldery section to the rocky summit of Stob Ghabhar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14757040986" title="Summit of Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2915/14757040986_28b501429c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised to find I had this popular summit to myself. It was late afternoon though and I sat in the peaceful sunlight eating a final snack and looking back along the sweeping crest of peaks that I had traversed since leaving Ben Starav a few hours earlier. I could glimpse into upper Glen Kinglass and follow the line of my outward route from Loch Tulla all the way to Glenkinglass House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14799910303" title="Cruachan and Starav ranges from Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/14799910303_c60a16b7e2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cruachan and Starav ranges from Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loch Tulla shone in the afternoon sunlight with the Bridge of Orchy hills picked out nicely, clouds drifting lazily about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593411528" title="Across Loch Tulla by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5575/14593411528_3a7847ba8e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Across Loch Tulla"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rannoch Moor dominated the view northeastwards, and to the northwest the eye was led across countless mountain peaks to the broad back of Ben Nevis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14779713342" title="Rannoch Moor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2900/14779713342_eefbbd5784_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Rannoch Moor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westward were the shapely peaks of Ben Cruachan and Ben Starav, a shimmering line marking the sea separating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593572897" title="The Ben Starav range from Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3902/14593572897_3f06339400_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Ben Starav range from Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took one last look about, peered into the dark waters of Coire Lochain and then made my way off the top, following the clear baggers track heading for the start of the Aonach Eagach ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593437328" title="The Glen Lyon hills from Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14593437328_5c9c9a71e4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="The Glen Lyon hills from Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge wasn’t my destination today though, having already traversed it in winter conditions I was quite content to drop off from the heights and start the long ascent downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593434839" title="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5586/14593434839_1f405e9e11_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Aonach Eagach of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I descended something caught in my peripheral vision and I stopped to watch as a paraglider climbed in tight circles on a handy thermal. They then glided off beyond Stob a' Choire Odhair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impressive eastern face of Stob Ghabhar caught my attention before I turned away from the ridge and started the descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14757119276" title="Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2908/14757119276_b8199b5b7b_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path is easy to follow but steep at times and requires concentration as the surface is loose and slippy with the occassional sunken rock waiting to trip you up. It was hard to concentrate though as the light shifted in the glen and everything started to illuminate wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593632687" title="Loch Dochard by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3870/14593632687_d558f5dd39_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Dochard"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I was on a more grassy section, making good progress and starting to catch a group ahead of me. The views over Loch Tulla to the Bridge of Orchy Munros led me onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14780163155" title="Descent of Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5585/14780163155_0948f6f7dd_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Descent of Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I was past a delightful waterfall and then making my way down the very steep section below Creag an Steallaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14800040873" title="Waterfall below Coire na Muic by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3835/14800040873_e076a68c31_b.jpg" width="683" height="1024" alt="Waterfall below Coire na Muic"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Allt Toaig (with some modern additions) was reached and crossed easily and then it was a straightforward march back down to the Abhainn Shira and my outward route. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14779837282" title="Sculptures on the Allt Toaig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3837/14779837282_58de16381e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Sculptures on the Allt Toaig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the mountain hut I caught up with the group ahead of me. They had enjoyed a grand day out on Stob Ghabhar and seemed impressed with the fact I had come along from Ben Starav. We had a good chat as we walked down to the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14593543118" title="Stob Ghabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14593543118_2651e620f2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Stob Ghabhar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the hut (with its respectful signage) I left them to a gentle meander back and put on some speed, covering the short mile back to the car quickly. The light was beautiful and it was a shame to have to leave behind these wonderful hills that had been my playground for the weekend. Nevertheless I was quickly changed and rehydrated myself aware of the fairly long drive back to Aberdeen that now awaited me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the sun shining I rolled the windows down and turned the music up, enjoying the rollercoaster ride back along the single track to the Bridge of Orchy and then along to Tyndrum. Though I was mighty envious of those supping pints outside the Inveroran and Bridge of Orchy hotels all such feelings evaporated as I tucked, a few minutes later, into a mighty fine fish supper sitting outside in the sunshine at the Real Food Cafe. I’m not sure this trip could have really gone any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not often that I find myself doing a day walk out of season and on a week day. Such it was that on Friday morning I found myself walking down the main road through Strontian, decked out for another day in the wintry hills of Ardgour and with an ice axe strapped to my pack, threading my way between mums and children heading to school!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiXjsG" title="Strontian and Loch Sunart by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Strontian and Loch Sunart" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/12017595516_bee918271a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a dead calm morning and a heavy frost lay everywhere, the land almost merging with the still waters of Loch Sunart. Walk Highlands suggests starting this walk from higher up the glen beyond Strontian, but unsure of the road conditions and tempted by a proper car park rather than the grass verge higher up I opted for this route which really only added on a couple of kilometres to either end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the river and then left the main road behind to enter the still confines of Phemie's Walk. This delightful little stretch of woodland rose up the hill beyond the village and offered good paths that threaded their way amongst the trees, autumnal foliage drifiting on the floor and crunching underfoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiSJtr" title="IMG_6012 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_6012" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3712/12016700735_2055f21572_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A path leaves the waymarked routes at the top of hill and then crosses the common grazing land to meet the farm lane. As I crossed the pastureland I could see that Ben Resipol was attracting some cloud though there was still some weak sunshine hitting the hills further into Ardgour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiWet5" title="Common Grazing above Strontian by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Common Grazing above Strontian" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/12017383606_90f178d6be_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiThyr" title="Loch Sunart by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Sunart" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3798/12016808673_d341d9ed21_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farm lane took me north in parallel with Strontian river and I enjoyed the views down over the sinuous village, a hazy mist rising up amongst the houses. Away down the glen the hills of Ardgour, Sgurr Dhomhnuill's twin summit most prominent, stood, sharply defined in the morning sun as it rose somewhere beyond Lochaber. The ground was frozen with puddles and icy pools but I was able to avoid the worst of the slippery surface and picked my way along to the point where the Right of Way to Polloch branches off and starts to climb the slopes of Beinn a' Chaorainn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiTwxu" title="Ardgour hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ardgour hills" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3775/12016855714_6143848574_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track wound its way up the hillside, following the course of a burn that tumbled down in a series of different waterfalls. Progress was hindered only slightly when a misplaced foot caught the edge of an ice patch and I came tumbling down, luckily landing in the heather. After that I spent a little more time watching my feet and a little less time gazing off at the sunlit hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views opened out as I gained height and soon I was looking back at Garbh Beinn as its shadowy flanks came into view across the way beyond Ariundle. Cloud was swiftly gathering as I left the icy track behind and followed a minor burn up the final stretch of hillside to reach the northeastern shoulder of Beinn a' Chaorainn. This provides the shortest route from the Polloch track to Ben Resipol, my target for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiUCUh" title="Northeastern shoulder of Beinn a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northeastern shoulder of Beinn a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/12017072216_a244838008_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground was wet but I picked a dry line across the hillside until I passed through a rocky portal and got my first proper view of Ben Resipol. It's eastern spine stretched away westward and into the clouds but it was a magnificent sight nontheless. I stopped here for a bite of food and a drink, watching as the cloud started to veil the Ardgour hills. A glimpse of water told my that Loch Shiel was just in view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meall an t-Slugain, the bealach between me and Ben Resipol proved an interesting series of topographical challenges, the land constantly rising and falling, the going wet and at times dangerously icy. I steered a course through it all, relying on my poles more than usual. I was glad to start finally climbing the true slopes of Ben Resipol where I soon got into the snowline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light was rapidly changing as I hit steep ground and had to pick my way carefully uphill, the snow proving mostly soft and yielding to my Scarpas. The surrounding hills had almost disappeared but sunlight was still shining down to the south illuminating the hills beyond Loch Sunart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was good to reach the ridge proper and now I started threading my way over and amongst the rocky lumps, making my way gradually westward towards the snow slopes of Ben Resipol proper. I rose to meet the lowering cloud base until I was eventually lost in a mirky grey world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiPZ7Z" title="Ben Resipol's east ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Resipol's east ridge" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7421/12016164673_5570fc0d40_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn't much of a discernible track to follow so I chose my own line, climbing up the snowy slopes until the ridge eventually narrowed and there was just one way up. On a blue sky day this must be a spectacular walk. Entirely non-technical but enjoying a fabulous position with the slopes dropping away steeply on both sides. The ridge is wonderful and I enjoyed following its unwavering line upward through the whiteness and then across a series of false summits before I was finally climbing up to the summit of the Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiPL9W" title="Summit of Ben Resipol by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Ben Resipol" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2869/12016121054_99f6f0ca26_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped here for a well earned rest. It was mostly still but cold in the damp air. I munched a couple of sandwiches down, gazing off into the blank. In my mind I was looking out westward across the sea to the isles glittering under a blue sky. I was looking northward and eastward to the serried ranks of the Highlands. This is a summit I shall be revisiting for the full experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiPgEk" title="Ben Resipol, looking east from the summit by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Resipol, looking east from the summit" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2842/12016025203_e7d69b76b8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I donned my crampon's for the descent, knowing there were at least a couple of short steep descents which had been easy in ascent but might prove otherwise in the poor visibility. Then I was off, retracing my steps through the dim, veiled world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiRbY5" title="Ben Resipol's east ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Resipol's east ridge" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2831/12016399636_d095f19583_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skittered down the last of the snowy slopes, dislodging a crampon as the mossy grass took hold. I stopped to take them off and put them away, looking across at Beinn a' Chaorainn. I thought I might be able to take a more direct route back by heading to its summit and then dropping directly back down to the farm track above Strontian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/jiLpyp" title="Beinn a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3804/12015466435_ecec45ec58_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain came down harder and faster as I recrossed Meall an t-Slugain. From the high point on the eastern shoulder there wasn't much more ascent to make to the summit, perched on a rocky strip between peaty pools. I had a final drink, my hood pulled low over my brow, and then tried to find a way off the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy enough to pick a way down through the first set of crags but on inspection I decided that the upward track would be easier than picking my way across a good mile of peat and bog and dips and rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made my way back to the track, eventually picking up an argocat route for the final stretch and then it was downward, the rising temperature and drizzle making light work of the remaining ice patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down on the farm track and I had to do some avoidance moves around a large herd of cows which had taken up residence, and then it was back across the grazing land, down through the woods and back to the car for a short drive back across the bealach and up the coast to the cottage. Another fine day out despite the lack of views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout Monday successive weather fronts passed through, framed by the wide windows of our cosy cottage on the edge of Ardgour. Squally showers came racing down Glen Gour, one after another, the sky turning from blue to black in minutes. At first it was rain and wind but later, as the temperature fell, it turned to snow, the nearby hill tops turning white before the line crept slowly down to reach us at sea level. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 19th November 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 20.21km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 843m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Beinn na h-Uamha [Corbett]        &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very cold, snow underfoot, occasional cloud but mostly sunny             &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/414"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Tuesday morning all was calm. A blue sky arced above Ardgour as I stepped out of the cottage door and crunched my way down the snowy back road a short distance to pick up the right of way which winds down Glen Gour and eventually through to Strontian. A pair of dogs came bounding down the path to greet me, their owner giving me a cheerful hello as I followed the track down to the shores of icy Loch nan Gabhar where a line of semi-submerged stones led the eye to Beinn na h-Uamha, the day's intended hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVEcgF" title="Loch nan Gabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch nan Gabhar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/11765291513_2436f10dbe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glen was frosty, deep in the shadow of the hills and ice had crept out from the shore of the loch as I followed the track on its southern bank. The still air was broken only by the distant warbling of wildfowl - geese, ducks and a single swan - that were paddling slowly around one of the unfrozen patches. Unseen behind me the sun had risen and was slowly illuminating the sparkling caps of the mountains ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hPbM2C" title="Beinn na h-Uamha from Loch nan Gabhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn na h-Uamha from Loch nan Gabhar" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5522/11035686194_6d6b7d7399_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVBCCv" title="Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2874/11764791485_d55e3ed06a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen Gour is wide and flat, the track taking a direct course through it and passing by the odd ruined farm house and sheepfold. Gnarled trees, black against the snowy mountains, marched alongside the river away to my right. Behind me the early cloud was clearing from the hills around Loch Leven and there was a rosy glow above Loch Linnhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVCDmk" title="Track through Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Gour" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/11764989023_e2118ae119_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVB9vD" title="In Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="In Glen Gour" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/11764696895_c06fb02911_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVB1Gc" title="Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3831/11764670595_0839b811bc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beinn na h-Uamha now appeared much closer and I could start to pick out a route up its eastern ridge which cascaded down in a series of rocky falls from the subsidiary top of Stob an Uillt Dharaich. The track left the bank of the river for a short way but when it came close again the water was narrower, though no less cold looking. It was here that I would need to cross it to reach the lower slopes of the Corbett. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVEo2w" title="Down Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down Glen Gour" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/11765327696_abe4ff9a63_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With deep, swift water and a lack of helpful boulders I chose to take my boots and socks off. The water was frigid and by the time I reached the far side I was light-headed from the shock. I sat down, dried my feet, put my boots back on and enjoyed a hot drink from my flask which soon revived me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the boggy land on the north bank of the river, glad to reach the sunshine where I paused to look back at the impressive shape of Beinn Bheag back across the glen. The slopes of Beinn na h-Uamha were close now and I was soon starting the first part of the ascent. The sun was a welcome sight as it crested the hill behind me, quickly taking the chill off the morning as I wound my way around and below the first crags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVCd11" title="Down Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down Glen Gour" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/11764903744_51f29cc1cd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With crisp ground underfoot I was able to make quick work of the first part of the ascent, clambering my way up a fern-ridden gully and then traversing across to pick up the rockier ridge once I was above the first crags. The views back down Glen Gour were rapidly opening up and the light was spectacular as the cloud cleared from the hills around Ballachulish. Following the ridge upwards brought the chilly looking upper Glen Gour into view just as some high cloud started to roll in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVDiM1" title="Down Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down Glen Gour" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2853/11765118286_70e115caef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jumbled ridge leading to Stob an Uillt Dharaich now stretched out ahead and above me and I enjoyed weaving in and out of craggy bands and across snowier sections. The weather felt a bit more threatening now and with the sun gone I was zipping up against the cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVAceK" title="Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/11764510953_c7067280ea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVA174" title="Beinn Bheag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Bheag" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7366/11764473503_a5de677651_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVCoxW" title="Sgorr Mhic Eacharna by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgorr Mhic Eacharna" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5498/11764939236_193976ea9e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below Stob an Uillt Dharaich the cloud broke again and I was greeted by blue skies. The Stob is imposing from this aspect and rather than tackling it directly I climbed up and contoured around its north-eastern slopes until there was a less precipitous route up. It was still steep but with traces of a path to follow and snow-covered tussocky grass progress was swift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVzp9t" title="Head of Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of Glen Gour" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/11764355903_a76059d1cf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVBQrG" title="Stob an Uillt Dharaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stob an Uillt Dharaich" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/11764831226_0a8a512b4f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVxPYV" title="Loch Linnhe and Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Linnhe and Glen Gour" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5509/11764049225_829a9130b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me the views out to Loch Linnhe continued to improve. I soon emerged on the top of Stob an Uillt Dharaich, the sun now fully out and the way forward impressive. The snow was crunchy and a few inches deep and I was soon heading up towards the col before the final climb to Beinn na h-Uamha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVzoqW" title="Loch Linnhe and Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Linnhe and Glen Gour" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7308/11764353494_ca4c16736e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views out across Ardgour were improving with every step and I could start to see the trench of Glen Scaddle beyond the high ground to the north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVAWmu" title="A' Bheinn Bhan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="A' Bheinn Bhan" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5512/11764655996_b2a06f7ed6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting to the col included a bit more scrambling and an interesting traverse high above one of the gullies that dropped back down into Glen Gour. With firm snow underfoot I took careful footsteps along the narrow ledge which led up to the col.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVyuNN" title="Across Glen Gour from Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Across Glen Gour from Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5475/11764179834_072e2d2fe5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were now better views as the increased height continued to give me new perspectives. Away to the northeast Ben Nevis was emerging from cloud, whilst to the southeast were the various peaks around Glen Etive. To the north I could see the Glenfinnan and Rough Bound hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVzYdN" title="Light over Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light over Etive" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/11764467166_251f43a2df_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Away to the east the mighty ramparts of Garbh Bheinn of Ardgour had risen above the lower hills lining Glen Gour's upper reaches. It was a thrilling sight as its buttresses caught the shining sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upper slopes of Beinn na h-Uamha now beckoned and I threaded my snowy footsteps through the final rock bands as I climbed up to the summit cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVz37S" title="Ardgour from Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ardgour from Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2857/11764285166_3a0e59d434_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was breathtaking at the summit. A chill wind blew but I stood gazing out all around at the magical views. For a hill that barely scrapes its Corbett status there are some big views and I took as much of it in as I could before retreating below the cairn for a break from the wind and a spot of lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVyacL" title="Sgurr Dhomhnuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr Dhomhnuill" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/11764113886_653e9c2793_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking down into Glen Scaddle I could see the meeting of the rivers where I had camped on the second night of my &lt;a href="/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/"&gt;April Ardgour Adventure&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVvab6" title="Towards Glen Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glen Scaddle" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7301/11763528453_00da37cca2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed lunch with a view, gazing all the way back down the length of Glen Gour to where the cottage stood close to the shores of Loch Linnhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVvvU1" title="Towards Loch Leven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Loch Leven" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7429/11763598164_caa417b5e0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinctive cone of Sgurr Dhomhnuill dominated the view to the west, around it arrayed the other hills of Ardgour and Morvern and Sunart, a wonderful corner of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVwZaJ" title="Sgurr Dhomhnuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr Dhomhnuill" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/11763885016_eb15108ebb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVv5Xh" title="Garbh Bheinn of Ardgour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Garbh Bheinn of Ardgour" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2885/11763514254_22d654c3d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a final few minutes to look around and then made my mind up. Rather than backtracking and using one of the eastern ridges to descend, I would continue on my way westward and then descend back to Glen Gour by the wide coire below the western top of Beinn na h-Uamha. Garbh Bheinn to the south and Sgurr Dhomhnuill dominated the view as I made my way beyond the cairn and along the undulating summit plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVuDVy" title="Summit of Beinn na h-Uamha by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn na h-Uamha" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3703/11763430054_79ba46163a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVtdyc" title="Sgurr a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/11763149603_2733db72c1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the hill was dropping away and I was heading down to the bealach before Sgurr a' Chaorainn. The land was steep in parts with crags to avoid but mostly I was descending snow slopes. Sgurr Dhomhnuill continued to impress as its sides appeared above upper Glen Scaddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVvrMf" title="Sgurr Dhomhnuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr Dhomhnuill" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2844/11763584316_5b61f2fa53_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bealach is topographically complex with a number of riven gullies descending from it. After negotiating a final rocky step which was coated with thick ice I found myself above one of these gullies and decided to use it as a handrail to get down into the coire below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVv82j" title="Sgurr a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2882/11763521216_2e542fa574_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an initial steep section I was soon on easier angled slopes and picking my way down through the coire and back into the gloom of Glen Gour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVrbCn" title="Descent to Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent to Glen Gour" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3687/11762752893_7ae531e269_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the bank of a stream, crossing it lower down and then cutting off a corner by making my way across frosty grass and then wending my way along the floor of the glen to where, some distance off, I could see the faint signs of a vehicle track emerging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind me the sun set behind the riven head wall of Glen Gour, the light slowly receding up the slopes of Beinn a' Chaorainn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVnoeD" title="Last light in Upper Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Last light in Upper Glen Gour" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/11762011495_8cb8767fa9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track came and went as it passed through and around boggy sections. Progress was a bit laborious but it was privilege but to be in this quiet place surrounded by the hills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVnTgV" title="Sgurr a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/11762109183_13e69ef3ce_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud was starting to build in the west, tracking my progress as I headed eastward through the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVmVbt" title="Sgurr a' Chaorainn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr a' Chaorainn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/11761920483_02160a64bf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track wound its way down to the River Gour, a short distance upstream from where I had crossed on the outward leg. Whether the flow was just less or whether I had lucked out with boulders, this time I was able to get across dryshod in boots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/iVp8Yb" title="Beinn Bheag from Glen Gour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Bheag from Glen Gour" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2850/11762353726_264b809538_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was soon back on the track I had followed through the glen in the morning, easily retracing my steps. As the cloud overtook me I stopped for a final drink stop enjoying the final sunlight playing out over the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed Loch na Gabhar, the views much more solemn than a few hours previous, and soon was in the cottage, getting a good fire going in the stove and sitting down with a cuppa and cake, putting the feet up after a brilliant day in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying over at the Youth Hostel in Crianlarich meant that, on Saturday morning, rather than a 3 hour drive from Aberdeen leaving home at 5am, I had a 15 minute drive leaving the hostel at 7:30am. It was a little misty down in Crianlarich but the sun was shining in Tyndrum when I passed through a few minutes later. By the time I pulled into the scrappy layby near the entrance to Auch Estate a few minutes south of the Bridge of Orchy it was thick mist and very poor visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gMv8i2" title="Spider webs in the morning sun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spider webs in the morning sun" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/10360276623_26a35442c3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan for the weekend had been an overnighter with a camp up by Loch Lyon on Saturday night. However, the weather forecast was for the first serious autumn storm system moving in and by Sunday daybreak it was supposed to be extremely windy and rainy. Now, I don’t mind waking up to some drizzle but the thought of walking out wet, and then driving home through bad conditions for three hours didn’t really appeal. So I modified my plans, ditched all the camping gear in the boot of the car, and set off with a light day pack and a plan to see how far around the planned route I would get (given the topography of these hills it would be easy to cut the route short at several points). That route is one of Dan Bailey’s &lt;a href="http://www.cicerone.co.uk/product/detail.cfm/book/612/title/great-mountain-days-in-scotland"&gt;50 Great Mountain Days in Scotland&lt;/a&gt;, a Cicerone book that is fast becoming my favourite route guide for long single days or pleasant overnighters. It involved climbing all five of the Munros east of the Bridge of Orchy which are typically climbed in two groups of two, and a one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKM2nN" title="West Highland Line Viaduct at Auch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="West Highland Line Viaduct at Auch" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/10340745516_156e1e40d0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk started off gently enough. From the main road the Auch estate road is followed down across the wide, flat strath through which the river Kinglass flows. Everything was shrouded in thick mist and soon I left behind the traffic noise and the barking of dogs at one of the estate buildings. I crossed over the river and a short distance later the curved railway viaduct appeared out of the gloom. Beyond it the hills of the Auch Glen rapidly crowd in and dark walls rear up on either side, their tops craggy and forbidding as cloud thickened and thinned about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I got further down the glen, the gentle bubble of the river Kinglass besides me, the weather started to improve. There were glimpses of blue sky above and in patches a watery sun was making its way down to the glen floor. After crossing the river and passing a small plantation I left the good track and started my ascent of the northern side of the glen. Ultimately this would lead me up to the summit of Beinn Dorain by its less visited north-eastern ridge. The climb was steep on trackless, wet grass that tested the traction of my footwear. I made steady progress though and it wasn’t long before I was able to define craggy shapes above me, dark against a clear blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few metres higher up I popped above the mist completely. A perfect inversion filled the lower part of the Auch glen, illuminated by the rising sun. The cool temperature of the glen was left behind and I was down to base-layer as I wound my way around the crags on the loosely defined eastern ridge of Meall Tionail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slope eased and I found myself on a rolling grassy plateau where a few sheep were grazing. All around were fabulous mountain views, particularly to the northeast where the mist was breaking up in the Auch glen and Loch Lyon could be seen beyond Beinn Mhanach’s green, grassy slopes. There was a little cloud still playing around the Munros that surrounded me, including Beinn a’ Dothaid and Beinn Achaladir but further east the hills were cloud free. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind me the dark slopes of Meall Garbh rose up towards Beinn Dorain. I wound my way across the lumpy ground until I hit the bouldery north east ridge. It was a sharp, steep pull up but the terrain wasn’t too tricky and I gained height quickly. Behind me the views developed over the Mamlorns. Sadly as I climbed the cloud thickened all around me. One by one the summits were lost from view and finally I was walking in mist up to the cairn marking the subsidiary top of Meall Garbh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a little disappointing after the earlier sunshine but the pleasant ridge walking was enjoyable and the yawning gulfs as the crags on the south side plunged away into the Auch glen were spectacular, half veiled by the mist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKdFz2" title="Looking into the Auch Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking into the Auch Glen" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/10334435303_94cb6f79e2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I pulled up to the large cairn marking the end of the north east ridge and immediately picked up the baggers path that took me along the undulating south-west spur to the summit itself. All was quiet and I found no-one but a couple of corvids at the Munro’s cairn. The mist muted the traffic noise from the A82 below and I enjoyed a quiet few minutes eating some food and looking out for any thinning of the mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKcYzu" title="Summit of Beinn Dorain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn Dorain" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5473/10334297406_704bcf111c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t seem to be happening so I once more shouldered my pack and headed back along the ridge, following the bagger’s path as it rapidly lost height through an eroded gully. As I descended I started to meet a few folk coming up from the bealach. The cloud thinned as I got below the 800m contour and I enjoyed fine views up towards Glen Lyon and across Loch Tulla towards the Black Mount and Etive hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKd4RQ" title="Descent from Beinn Dorain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent from Beinn Dorain" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2893/10334315174_2bb280410c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of people were heading for Beinn Dorain first so it was a quiet track that took up the slopes of Beinn an Dothaid on the far side of the bealach. The track is a good one, bypassing the steeper crags above the Bridge of Orchy and slowly contouring up into a high coire below the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKgdBD" title="Looking back to Beinn Dorain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back to Beinn Dorain" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2839/10334929963_a88f8019e0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than head directly for the summit I climbed up trackless grassy slopes to the western top. It was gratifying to see that the improvement in the weather had continued apace and so I enjoyed fine, expansive views out over Rannoch Moor to where Glen Coe and the big hill groups of the West Highlands stood still largely shrouded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break here I picked up the southern lip of Coire Achaladair with views across to Beinn Achaladair and made my way along the ridge to the Munro summit of Dothaid. Here I stopped for lunch, enjoying the views as they opened out around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit I continued east to the final top which marks the start of a steep, grassy descent down to the pronounced bealach separating Dothaid from Achaladair. By now the sun was out and it was an enjoyable stretch of grassy ridge along from the bealach towards Achaladir. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views out over Rannoch Moor and toward Loch Lyon were spectacular and everything looked a lot mroe summery now with the sun streaming down between fast moving clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achaladair is a long mountain with a flattish summit ridge marked by a series of cairns and rocky crests.  The views from the winding path up from the coire to the summit itself were fabulous though it was clear more interesting weather was coming in as showers swept across Rannoch Moor from Glencoe. Meanwhile in the east the sun was shining over the Lawers Range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the Munro summit itself but continued on a short way to a more distinctive cairn where there was a good spot to sit with my legs dangling over the edge looking down on the railway as it curves away from the road and making its way towards remote Rannoch Station. I drew my hood up as the rain arrived and looking back the way I had come saw that Beinn Dorain and Beinn an Dothaid were now covered once again by cloud. The long range visibility was good and I could see the end of Loch Ericht framed by the hills on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the weather closing in I carried on, wondering whether I would get much of a view on the remaining two Munros. The eastern side of Beinn Achaladair is spectacular with path following the edge of its steep flanks where crags plunge down towards the forestry far below. I wound my way down the ridge enjoying some occasional brief scrabbles down rocky steps. The views had largely gone as I reached the bealach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKmnYA" title="Loch Tulla from Beinn Achaladair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Tulla from Beinn Achaladair" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/10335937014_e4795a9984_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the bealach the terrain returned to its more normal grassy self and it was a steady plod up the other side onto Beinn a' Chreachain's southern top. Behind me Beinn Achaladair's dramatic profile was revealed in full as the light continued to change over Rannoch Moor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds swept in and the hills were obscured as I started the final climb up Beinn a' Chreachain's steep western side. I gave into the rain and donned full waterproofs. The rain didn't relent until the final walk along the ridge to the large cairn marking the summit of the day's fourth Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKnwBh" title="Summit of Beinn a'Chreachain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn a'Chreachain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7428/10336161166_4754b718a3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mist swirled as I sat and had a drink and something to eat. I'm sure this must be a fantastic vantage point for Loch Lyon and the Lawers range but after twenty or so minutes I still hadn't seen anything so I traced my steps back to the start of the descent path. I'd only taken a few steps down when the clouds suddenly cleared and there was blue sky around again. I turned and headed back up to the shoulder of the Munro to catch some striking views across Rannoch Moor and up to the summit which gradually appeared out of the gloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was progressing and late afternoon light bathed the hills as I descended back off Beinn a' Chreachain, mostly following my outward footsteps to the col below Beinn Achaladair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKoyHD" title="Beinn Achaladair by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Achaladair" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/10336363375_3e5e11e1f1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final Munro of the round could now clearly be seen, standing somewhat on its own with steep slopes guarding all sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached the bealach I turned downslope to follow the gentle coire across a number of streams to reach the col below Beinn Mhanach. I had been a little concerned that there might be stalking going on in this remote area but there was no sign of movement as I surveyed the scene and I was soon enough across and picking my way up to the saddle before the summit of Beinn Mhanach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKq3Fk" title="Beinn Mhanach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Mhanach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/10336652545_a763ab5f07_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern top, Beinn a' Chuirn, was just a short distance away so I decided to visit that first, knowing that the descent from Beinn Mhanach itself was somewhat gentler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKqcbr" title="Tyndrum Hills from Beinn a'Chuirn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tyndrum Hills from Beinn a'Chuirn" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/10336681145_a17b08cfd6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this brief detour I headed over to Beinn Mhanach. Since the clearing on the previous hill the weather had only improved and now the views were grand and the Mamlorns across Loch Lyon were catching some beautiful evening sunshine as the shadows lengthened. It was a glorious time to up high, all alone on the fifth and final Munro of the trip and I spent ages watching the shifting light and soaking up the views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conscious of a long drive ahead and that the weather couldn't last forever I tore myself reluctantly away from the summit and started my descent, following an easy line down into the Auch Glen which opened up below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fTT7ft" title="The Auch Glen from Beinn Mhanach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Auch Glen from Beinn Mhanach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/9776107783_e4cf148ccc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I was down and on the good track that would take me all the way back to the car. The going was largely uneventful as the clouds thickened and the beautiful light faded. Someway down the glen I found the track taken over by a heard of cows with calves. Not wanting to cause any disturbance I crossed the stream and thwacked my way through heather and bog to go around them, rejoining the track once I had passed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKswfx" title="Looking back up to the Beinn Mhanach saddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back up to the Beinn Mhanach saddle" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5531/10337135523_63ce05b872_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it was all straightforward and soon enough the viaduct appeared and the hills receded. The mist had returned to the crags around Beinn Dorain and there was the slightly unusual sight of a tent pitched directly under the viaduct to take in before I was climbing back up the road to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stretches and a change of clothes and then it was down to Tyndrum for a fish supper at the Real Food Cafe before a dark but easy drive back across the country to Aberdeen. A long but rewarding day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gKs7H5" title="West Highland line viaduct by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="West Highland line viaduct" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5492/10337056326_a7157c97e6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was slightly sad not to be still out in the tent but the weather on the Sunday lived up to predications and I was glad I had made the call to squeeze it into a day. Sometimes its good to do long miles and see the changing light and perspectives all in one go.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="west highlands"></category><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>The Ben Cruachan Group</title><link href="https://tms.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2013/06/ben-cruachan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-09T12:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-06-09T12:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.invertedworld.co.uk,2013-06-09:/blog/2013/06/ben-cruachan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overnight backpacking trip taking in the two Munros to the north of the Lairig Noe, a wander through Glen Kinglass and by Loch Etive, then returning (after a high camp) by way of the Ben Cruachan ridge including its two Munros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was off into the bright warm sunshine a little after 9:30am. The skies were a deep, beautiful blue with only a few fluffy white clouds around.  Under them the hills were green, a few patches of snow lingering here and there in dark recesses of their upper slopes. An easy track took me around the side of Castles farm and then led through a couple of gates to the Lairig Noe track. I caught and passed a family of three enjoying the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lairig track climbed steadily with views starting to open out ahead to the hills and behind to Loch Awe. I came up to the cairned junction marking the start of a narrow track which would get me up to the Beinn Eunaich ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path up the hillside was steep and in places eroded but did make for rapid progress up the 400m or so of elevation it took to gain the ridge. Behind me the views opened out as the woods and water of Loch Awe were revealed. Kilchurn castle was a dark shape amongst the green of the trees. Across the Lairig Noe the Cruachan massif opened up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge of Beinn Eunaich was wide and curved upwards towards the summit, an easy slope on short grass. The only downside of this easy stroll up, especially considering the hot weather and unwavering sunlight, was the lack of water. Every tiny stream was dry, the ground occasionally damp, but nothing more substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit cairn was reached with little fuss and I put down the pack to admire the views. I rationed out some water and munched on some trail mix looking back east to the Ben Lui group and north towards the Bridge of Orchy hills and the Black Mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eME5vG" title="Summit of Beinn Eunaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn Eunaich" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3695/9049309738_9cfe2da656_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediately to my west was the grassy ridge extending down and around to the more interesting summit of Beinn a Chochuill, the next Munro of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMsYUg" title="Beinn a' Chochuill and Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Chochuill and Loch Etive" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/9047144631_c79e6a717d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was an easy path to follow down the steep western slopes of Beinn Eunaich and then it was a gentle climb back up towards the next hill. Sadly even at the bealach there was no sign of running water so I continued to ration out my bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMsr6g" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5537/9047037621_3d20d02abd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a short steep pull up from the bealach but then the ridge widened and provided easy grassy walking with absolutely wonderful views on all sides. Glen Kinglass led the eye towards the Bridge of Orchy whilst the Cruachan range, its dark northern coires on display, marched to my left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMDwzQ" title="Beinn a' Chochuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Chochuill" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2878/9049202330_0d060570fd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught back up with the family of three as I neared the summit. They had missed out Eunaich and ascended Chochuill by a rib above the Lairig Noe. Again the summit cairn commanded a lofty view and a short distance west brought with it the sight of the western coast with Lismore and Mull out in the clear blue sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was hardly a breath of wind and it was wonderfully warm. I found myself a spot to sit down, perched on the edge of the northern crags looking out across to Glen Kinglass and Ben Starav. Wispy high cloud had developed and there were other clouds rolling through that made for beautiful, ever changing patterns of shape and light in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMrJGV" title="Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Starav" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5322/9046901765_c176a229e3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several people arrived during my lunchtime siesta, all commenting on the views and the weather. It indeed was sublime and I could happily have stayed there all afternoon. As it was I could also see my planned route layed out before me, winding across to Glen Kinglass, which in turn would lead me to Loch Etive. From there the plan was to follow the lochside track south to Glen Noe and then use that glen to access the Cruachan hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMryBK" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/9046867825_b2bfa1d185_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long western ridge of Beinn a’ Chochuill was a delight in the warm afternoon sunshine. The views out towards Mull drew me forward and in no time I was at the funny little notched summit above Coire a' Chochuill.  The views across Glen Noe to the dramatic northern slopes of the Cruachan massif were very impressive, and not a little intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMCy5u" title="Mull and Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mull and Loch Etive" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/9049012244_fc2c443320_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was very nearly a little stream here but what should have been flowing water was a series of barely connected stagnant pools. Deer tracks ran off into the coire but I climbed steeply up to reach the craggy summit which would lead me onto a rib running down towards the upper catchment of Glen Liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMCuVq" title="Glen Etive and Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Etive and Ben Starav" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/9049001626_927919583b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge was steep but easy to descend and as I reached the craggy lower slopes I dropped into the coire, quickly cutting across to the stream where there was fresh water tinkling down between rocks. The Cruachan area is famous for its hydro schemes and this side of the hills is no different with almost every sizeable stream diverted into the hydro catchment. I wasn’t entirely sure of the water quality with all this human intrusion around but a cursory study gave the appearance I was still above the inflows. I was very thirsty and glugged down a litre of water fresh from the stream. Then I refilled the bottle and popped in a hydration tablet. This should get me along to the next water crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMCjCA" title="Ben Starav from Coire a' Chocuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Starav from Coire a' Chocuill" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/9048967010_c2f15806b0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now had a choice: to cut straight across the upper Liver and make for the descent down into Glen Kinglass, or to follow one of the hydro access tracks around the rim of the coire and then head up Meall Voirlich on the far side. In the end I opted for the latter, following the grassy track along several inflows and pipes and then crossing firm ground to reach an unnamed lochan with good views back up to Beinn Eunaich, the day’s first Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMqJYa" title="Beinn Eunaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Eunaich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2819/9046707537_2d2cb7071d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMqPdZ" title="Meall Voirlich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Voirlich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/9046721853_5540d0c876_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it was an easy ascent up Meall Voirlich which doesn’t appear prominent or high enough to appear on any hill lists. Despite this anonymity it provided excellent views down into Glen Kinglass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMqH5v" title="Glen KInglass from Meall Voirlich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen KInglass from Meall Voirlich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7319/9046701177_44b556c98a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I traversed the lumpy tops of this obscure hill, looking back up to the long ridge of Beinn a’ Chochuill which hid me from the main Cruachan massif. Then it was down a steep descent into the unpathed coire leading down to Glen Kinglass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMquhT" title="Across Glen Kinglass to Ben Starav by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Across Glen Kinglass to Ben Starav" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3812/9046658163_44ba9c142d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From over 3,000ft I was now almost back down to sea level and the vegetation in the coire reflected this. As I descended the stream dropped into a narrow slotted ravine whilst I followed deer tracks that kept higher up. On the other side it looked like a reasonably clear deer track made easier progress down. I came down into ferns and long grasses and the ground became increasingly boggy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMBJfQ" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5514/9048851372_02be6da01d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I could see the bridge over the Kinglass I was aiming for and after contouring the hillside for a while, descended down a tributary stream until I crashed through the ferns and reached the river. It was a hot and sticky descent and I was glad when it was over. The wobbly bridge spanning the Kinglass provided some entertainment and then it was onto a clearer vehicle track to follow the north bank of the river down towards Loch Etive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t gone far downstream when I came across an idyllic meadow of bluebells leading down to a flat shelf of rock by the river. The sun shone and it was hot and still. I couldn’t resist the temptation and was quickly into the wonderfully clear waters of the Kinglass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMpShF" title="Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9046537047_409378e021_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river was slow and lazy just here and I enjoyed bobbing around in the water my limbs enjoying the rest and relaxation. Back on the bank I lay back to air dry in the sunshine before continuing on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMD8CP" title="River Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7426/9049125131_ecebfc9cd3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen Kinglass on a sunny afternoon is sublime. A couple of 4x4s passed me by but otherwise it was idyllic. In the lower glen there was a great abundance of natural forest and below these there were wildflowers everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMpCwT" title="Bluebells in Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bluebells in Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/9046490775_ce6e7a882f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came down to the junction with the Loch Etive track near Ardmaddy and there across the way was the most beautiful tract of bluebell wood, the light filtering down through the canopy of leaves. I spent a few moments treading through the grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMppke" title="Track in Glen Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track in Glen Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7342/9046446367_a1661ddaa1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on track it was about 5pm and with the evening stretching out warm and inviting in front of me I ambled along the track that winds along the shores of Loch Etive. Across the Kinglass and then up to the first headland brought with it wonderful views back up the loch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMoTLH" title="River Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/9046346925_73d696e95f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMoNaz" title="Loch Etive from the Kinglass by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etive from the Kinglass" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/9046328067_2ed98cb20e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Starav’s stark grey flanks towered on the near shore whilst further back were the hills of Glencoe. The waters of the loch were deep blue, broken by buoys and fish nets. In the distance a fishing boat puttered along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMoLbM" title="Kinglass Estuary by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kinglass Estuary" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2875/9046321409_a5d0e7ae93_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once around the corner I got my first views of the Cruachan ridge standing tall above Glen Liver and a more distant Glen Noe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMoBpa" title="Ben Cruachan from Loch Etive track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Cruachan from Loch Etive track" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5484/9046291851_7dc8c03ccf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped down to the bay at Inverliver where I got a friendly wave from a chap in a 4x4. Just up from the bay I found a tinkling stream. It was hard to tell its exact course but the water seemed crisp and clear enough so I refilled my bottle. I passed the neat houses at Inverliver and then continued around the next headland again enjoying sensational views down Loch Etive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMzQu3" title="Fishing boat on Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fishing boat on Loch Etive" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3771/9048482098_c600a8a4cb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the farmhouse at Glennoe I had my final chance to follow my initial route up to the summit of the Lairig Noe. All day I had been studying the west end of the Cruachan ridge from as many angles as possible and concluded that it would be possible to access the ridge. More importantly the 600m peak lying immediately opposite me across Glen Noe promised lochans on its summit, a sign of potential flat land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMo984" title="Looking across Glennoe to Meall Copagach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across Glennoe to Meall Copagach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7322/9046200089_b95f110e1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMztGY" title="Cruachan hills above Glennoe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cruachan hills above Glennoe" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5497/9048412204_33f005f1d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditions were so good that I wanted that summit view and so I passed Glennoe, crossed the river and then picked my way through ferns, heather and sheep pasture to finally access the lower slopes of Meall Corpach. After finding a useful gap in a barbed wire fence I was heading up. It was a steep, steep climb, especially at the end of a long hot day, but my efforts were rewarded as the views opened up. Evening sunshine bathed Glen Noe and behind me lit up the waters of Loch Etive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMo1Yg" title="View up Glen Noe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="View up Glen Noe" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/9046176031_1423c2ece1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I climbed I followed the course of every possible stream I came across but found no running water besides a few dripping, slimy patches. I scrambled up a few small crags and finally the gradient eased. I was on the summit slopes of this little 600m gem and knew it was the place to stop for the night. The views out to Mull, up Loch Etive and up to the Cruachan ridge were just sublime. I scouted around but soon settled on a little balcony of moss and rock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMnRnX" title="Sunlight over Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight over Loch Etive" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/9046143765_65e0aaff31_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I’d ascended a stiff breeze had got up and it made erecting the tent a challenge. The first site turned out to be just a little short so I moved the tent slightly and found a much better pitch between two jumbled rocks. With the tent up I went to gather water, eventually having to settle for the larger of the three lochans I found. Not even the outflows were running. I would be boiling water then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the tent I was famished and soon had my dinner going. I was delighted to be back using meths and the Caldera Cone performed brillaintly even with a strong breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMncHg" title="Camped above Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camped above Loch Etive" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/9046017053_1af6d4047f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After mulling around the hillside enjoying the changing light and the cool evening air I made a hot chocolate and stood with it gazing out across the sunset sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eHj1H1" title="Hot Chocolate by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hot Chocolate" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7291/9000128714_681d5e14d8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun finally dipped below the western hills. With its light gone the wind dropped to stillness and so I moved the tent back around the corner to get the best of the views out to Mull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMQHS5" title="Setting sun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Setting sun" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7381/9051386508_14ff1928b5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As twilight faded the darkenening skies brought with them the first gleam of a bright display of noctilucent clouds. I stayed up long into the middle hours of the night watching the sky. It was an incredible experience; quite possibly the best night I've ever spent in the Scottish hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMQaAW" title="Noctilucent clouds by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Noctilucent clouds" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/9051277982_01da16b932_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN8tU3" title="Pre-dawn over Loch Etive by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pre-dawn over Loch Etive" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5337/9054656430_1a59c6536b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long day in the sun I was exhausted and in the warm, still conditions quickly drifted off into a happy sleep. I woke briefly at around 3 to see the dawn not far off. Everything was still and a little hazy but the noctilucent clouds still shimmered in the north. I thought about setting my alarm for sunset but was asleep again before I knew it and didn’t wake up until the warm sunlight hit the tent at about 6am. I dozed for a bit before finally rousing myself up to examine this new day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMW35x" title="Towards Mull by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Mull" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/9052423343_18c266ff98_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was more than acceptable. A haze had appeared out to sea and Mull was less clear than the previous night. Over the Etive mountains a little mist was lingering. Behind me the Cruachan range looked magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN8oJC" title="Towards Glencoe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glencoe" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/9054639064_db10b38c4c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed a cup of coffee and breakfast, slowly getting myself ready for the day ahead. It was almost too nice to move and I knew I had another 600m of vertical ascent pretty much straight from camp to get onto the top of the Cruachan ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN8a9G" title="Tent with Ben Cruachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tent with Ben Cruachan" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/9054593364_6bfe0f4f2a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part was a stiff climb up to the 900 odd metre high summit of Meall nan Each. It was pretty steep and even in the shade I was sweating furiously as I wound my way up between crags. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jumbled summit area of Meall nan Each provided a little relief, and, most joyfully, running water. I filled up on cool, crisp water before heading up the final little climb to this 900m hill just west of the main ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN7ToY" title="Stream on Meall Copagach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stream on Meall Copagach" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3675/9054540368_6ae4d97b64_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought with it an impressive perspective on the craggy western face of Taynuilt peak, the final high point on the Cruachan ridge. A couple of hundred metres of riven crags and blocky slabs turned to shattered rocks as the face met the bealach below me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was clearly  a no-go zone but, as I suspected from views the day before, the southern ridge was sensibly angled and looked to meet up with the slopes rising from the belach beyond the worst of the obstructive boulders and rocks. Access to the ridge looked possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN7K4y" title="West face of Taynuilt Peak by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="West face of Taynuilt Peak" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5511/9054512330_01e85772c9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drop to the bealach was steep but once again there was running water and after another drink I followed a rising contour, aiming for a distinctive block at the end of the southern ridge’s crags. This brought me around on grass with the occasional boulder field until I was on the south ridge. Below me the views opened up to Taynuilt itself and Loch Awe snaking its way beyond low, forested hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge was easy enough and hints of a path emerged at times as I wound up, occasionally encountering some very easy but enjoyable scrambling. I emerged on the summit at 10am delighted to have accessed the Cruachan ridge without any real trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMV5jz" title="Loch Etive Hills from Taynuilt Peak by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etive Hills from Taynuilt Peak" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2806/9052235773_b6d78e5b5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early mist had now started bubbling up into clouds here and there, the occasional plume spilling over the ridge to the east. Otherwise the views, though hazy, were glorious in all directions. I sat on the northern precipice eating a snack and gazing out across the hills. It was utterly still and I couldn’t spy a single person in view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here the Cruachan ridge stretched out eastward. Ben Cruachan was the next point along the ridge and I enjoyed the traverse across. The descent was steep on a stony path and then the reascent involved a couple of really nice scrambles on very grippy rock with great hand and foot holds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time at all I was on the 1,126m summit of Ben Cruachan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lofty perch with steep drops on both the north and south sides. To the east and west the ridge stretches out, westward giving views to Taynuitl Peak and out towards the sea, eastward looking along the winding ridge to Drochaid Glas and beyond to Stob Daimh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the summit, following the easy angled ridge as it dropped down towards the slabs and Cruachan's "bad step".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMTFGe" title="Drochaid Ghlas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Drochaid Ghlas" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/9051964545_5f6203f951_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped down to the step itself which sits poised above the Cruachan reservoir, vertiginous slopes dropping steeply down. Though I had ascertained that bypass was possible it wasn't necassay as the rock was incredibly grippy and after a slightly awkward first move I was soon up the slab and looking down the ridge beyond. The views back up to Cruachan were wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMTubV" title="Bad Step on Cruachan Ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bad Step on Cruachan Ridge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3705/9051925841_dc9f7035b8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the top of the step the ridge now eased and became a little grassier, interspersed with short rocky sections. Drochaid Glas gradually drew closer as I traversed the ridge high above the reservoir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge led me around to a cairned junction from which it was a short diversion north along a blocky ridge to reach the summit of Drochaid Glas, a Munro top. The views back to Ben Cruachan showed the distinctive curve of the east ridge with Taynuilt Peak a dark shape beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMSM6H" title="Summit of Drochaid Ghlas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Drochaid Ghlas" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/9051787615_d39679c5b1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now the cloud had thickend and was rolling in from the east plunging the grassy ridge to Stob Daimh, the next Munro, into shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMSv6k" title="Ridge to Stob Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ridge to Stob Daimh" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5537/9051733769_da14b68de5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned to the junction and then took the left hand fork dropping down a very steep and eroded path to join the easy angled ridge to Stob Daimh. I was now looking directly down the Cruachan Reservoir to the dam and Loch Awe beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMSs7H" title="Stob Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stob Daimh" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5537/9051723757_dd2b76b7e5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final climb up to Stob Daimh was easy on a good path and soon enough I was at the flat summit complete with small cairn. The views back down the ridge to Cruachan were magnificent despite the cloudier conditions. To the north I now had a good view across the Lairig Noe to the two Munros I had climbed the previous day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are a choice of descent ridges I thought it would be neat to close the loop around the Lairig Noe and descend via Sron an Isean's long grassy eastern ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMS3kx" title="Sron an Isean and descent ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sron an Isean and descent ridge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/9051643765_6eef3c06c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped down from Stob Daimh, following the northeastern ridge and peering down beyond the lochan and into Glen Noe with Loch Etive beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN4ct5" title="Glen Noe and Coire Lochain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Noe and Coire Lochain" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/9053820710_be3b4ea6b6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMRCx4" title="Sron an Isean by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sron an Isean" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/9051563697_9ab3c0f170_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I was on the summit of Sron an Isean, looking back to Stob Daimh, the peaks of Cruachan gradually being hidden from sight. I had views across the Lairig to Beinn a' Chochuill and Beinn Eunaich and across Glen Orchy Ben Lui stood in bright sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN3ZzQ" title="Stob Garbh and Stob Daimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stob Garbh and Stob Daimh" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3796/9053780734_47a8e64e59_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN3NTQ" title="Towards Ben Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Ben Lui" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/9053744774_09f504eb70_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now aimed for Ben Lui, angling eastward to follow the easy, broad grassy ridge down from the summit of Sron na Isean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN3KVN" title="Beinn a' Chochuill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Chochuill" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/9053734796_a0a463bc90_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMRg8p" title="Stob Garbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stob Garbh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/9051491681_6b12b499a0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a distinct path to follow and I made rapid progress, watching as the views across the coire back to Stob Garbh developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMRdZt" title="Beinn Eunaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Eunaich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2887/9051484493_61b2e1dbf2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN3wuG" title="Ben Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Lui" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/9053689608_4c26dd8c73_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I neared the end of the ridge the ground steepened and a number of crags sent me back and forth across the nose, eventually reaching the lower slopes, a sheep pasture and then the crossing of the Allt Mhoille. There were fabulous views back up Coire Glas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMR2Kg" title="Towards Loch Awe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Loch Awe" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9051446665_391109bf50_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMQYWZ" title="Nose of Sron an Isean by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Nose of Sron an Isean" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/9051437253_165e310b2b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN3nk7" title="Coire Glas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Glas" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3803/9053658776_9fa2afd540_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the stream crossing I stopped to replenish my water a final time. It was warm but pleasant in the shade of the trees but before long the midgies found me and so I moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMQNaH" title="Allt Mhoille by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt Mhoille" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2816/9051400987_1b105463ec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a last lingering look up the Lairig Noe before crossing the pastureland on a rough track to rejoin the track I had headed up the previous morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eMQHyc" title="Towards the Lairig Noe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Lairig Noe" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5488/9051385471_aff9af592e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an easy amble back to the car. The heat was intense, reflecting back off the tarmac and I was glad to get everything packed away, winding down the window to drive off with a cooling breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN36w9" title="Coire Glas by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Glas" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/9053605592_9dbdb41431_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed back to Tyndrum for a late lunch at the Real Food Cafe thoroughly enjoying fish and chips with an ice cold coke. Then it was just a small matter of driving back to Aberdeen. By the time I was home it was grey and damp again. Back to normality. Thanks to the west coast for providing more than enough vitamin D!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="summit camp"></category><category term="wild camp"></category><category term="ben cruachan"></category><category term="loch etive"></category></entry><entry><title>An Ardgour Adventure</title><link href="https://tms.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2013/04/ardgour-adventure/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-28T21:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-04-28T21:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.invertedworld.co.uk,2013-04-28:/blog/2013/04/ardgour-adventure/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A varied two night trip through the wilds of Ardgour taking in a Graham, two Corbetts and camps by Loch Shiel and the River Scaddle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Distance: 50.92km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 2,020m&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just two weeks left until the start of the TGO Challenge I decided it was about time I got out and did some backpacking. Recent weekends have been taken up by a number of interesting diversions with trips to see family in Yorkshire at Easter, a few nights in London followed by a wedding in Norfolk and then taking visitors around the delights of Royal Deeside. All of this amounted to a lot of good food, drink and travel, but very little hiking and certainly no nights spent cooped up in a tent listening to the Scottish rain hammering down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eeMVK2" title="Looking down Loch Shiel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down Loch Shiel" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8688713259_1ce345feaa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Maps" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nkPpKWHud3Q/UYUHvfxaGCI/AAAAAAAABhM/SSuoobV8vzI/w761-h571/IMG_20130425_123041.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was that I found myself making an early get-away from Aberdeen on a Friday morning and driving west through an ever changing mixture of sunshine, cloud-covered mountains and rain showers to reach the Corran Ferry south of Fort William. This glided across the glassy waters of Loch Linnhe to Ardgour and just a few miles north of the pier I parked up at the entrance to Cona Glen, one of the glens that runs east-west through the eastern end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula. After recently reading about &lt;a href="https://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/2013/04/11/backpacking-ardgour-the-cona-glen-corbetts-pt1-2/"&gt;James’ brilliant trip&lt;/a&gt; to this area my own plans had been solidified and looking for a mix of good glen walking, some hills and without worrying about conditions at Munro height I was here in Ardgour with a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPpu9" title="After crossing the loch, turn right by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="After crossing the loch, turn right" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8271/8700318196_10946b6d5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPq4E" title="Loch Linnhe from Ardgour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Linnhe from Ardgour" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8411/8700320140_35e2050f34_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another rain shower passed over it was under pleasant sunshine that I ambled my way into the peaceful confines of the glen. The river chattered away, the water level reasonably high, and I made good progress on an easy landrover track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efHG4t" title="Shower over Glen Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shower over Glen Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8272/8699203281_52fc10807f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efHHrk" title="The Cona River by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cona River" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8551/8699207913_bd7a88b0b9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPyEJ" title="Track in Cona Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track in Cona Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8115/8700349086_1debc796b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower Cona Glen is green and fertile and the narrow sides hide the mountains away from you but beyond the trees I came out into open upper reaches where a string of hills marched away on either side, culminating in the snow-capped twin peak of Sgurr Guibsachan, a Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efHSPK" title="Showers rushing down Cona Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers rushing down Cona Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8254/8699239489_d73f2c126b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efHTMT" title="Cona Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cona Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8128/8699242745_0b5e8fa9ac_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPEWN" title="Cona Glen Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cona Glen Track" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8140/8700370202_7a60b72520_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain came on heavier and I stopped to put on my waterproofs but beyond the locked cottage of Corriarach it slacked and then eased off completely, dark grey skies to bright sunshine in just a minute or two. As lunchtime had passed during the shower I left the track and paused down by the river for a wrap. The remarkable views pulled me onward and soon enough I was in the upper reaches of the glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPFZ3" title="Towards the head of Cona Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the head of Cona Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8407/8700373696_3bf10d83d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my left the Graham of Meall nan Damh offered an “inviting” climb and so rather than wade through the track building site I climbed steeply up to its heathery ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efJbLV" title="Meall nan Damh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall nan Damh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8545/8699299877_ff587f7117_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efPZXo" title="The Mountains of Ardgour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Mountains of Ardgour" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8558/8700434152_330b4f526e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I gained altitude it was clear the next shower was on its way and as I headed along the undulating summit plateau it hit in full force, a fierce northerly wind bringing bitingly cold snow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efJmgi" title="Cona Glen hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cona Glen hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8412/8699331799_ba69770e2b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused only briefly at the first summit but by the time I reached the west top it was easing and as I descended down slippery slopes to the glen of the Allt na Cruiche the sun returned and I quickly warmed back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efQeVW" title="Sgurr Ghiubhsachain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgurr Ghiubhsachain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8266/8700481164_b99793f977_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the boggy glen it was then a very waterlogged track that dropped me down towards the River Callop. Ahead of me a snow-capped Streap emerged from dark clouds. On the way I caught up a slow moving walker who turned out to be 70 years old and just embarking on the &lt;a href="http://www.capewrathtrail.co.uk/"&gt;Cape Wrath Trail&lt;/a&gt;. He was complaining about brining along 1.5kg of amateur radio equipment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing Callop and the public car park I turned onto the &lt;a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/ScotlandHighlandNoForestGlenfinnanPinewood"&gt;Forestry Commission&lt;/a&gt; road which runs along the southern side of Glen Callop. Here a series of side trails lead to viewpoints and I stopped at the “River View” for a late afternoon snack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efQykG" title="River Callop by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Callop" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8700543094_c85ed552e5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was onward, passing the branch off to the boardwalk that leads to the Glenfinnan Memorial and turning south the follow the east shore of Loch Shiel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/efQzZJ" title="Glenfinnan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glenfinnan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8559/8700548664_ba87271514_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now it was early evening, the rain showers had dried up and it was wonderful. The forestry road is a bit of a slog but the views to the high peaks of Ardgour and Moidart made up for it. At the cottage of Geusachan I found the place had become an industrial complex with fish farming and generators droning away. I was glad to leave it behind and as I approached the forestry spotted a likely looking spot right by the water’s edge. With two streams flowing into the loch and good views it was here that I would pitch for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit blowy as I got the tent up so I sheltered in the porch to cook dinner (soup, couscous, cheese and salami followed by tea and dark chocolate). As evening advanced the wind died down and I went to sit by the shore watching the light change over the water. This culminated in a beautifully subtle sunset that set the water off in hundreds of shades of pinks and oranges and purples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retired to my sleeping bag for another cuppa and to listen to some podcasts. Later on I went outside and found a glittering show of stars. It was calm by the water but a strong wind was teasing the clouds out over the tops of the hills. Back in the tent I snuggled up into my down cocoon and drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning was chilly but utterly still and sunny. Deep in the trench of Loch Shiel I didn’t get the direct sunlight and slept in until an hour or two after sunrise. Rising I got water on for coffee and porridge and then poked my head out to look at the reflection of Beinn Odhar Beag in the loch. It was a stunning morning and the forecast was good for the rest of the day, at least until early evening when the wind would sift back to the west, increasing in strength and bringing with it a bucketload of Atlantic ocean!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egjEsA" title="Loch Shiel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Shiel" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8131/8706026814_588cd8c514_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuelled up I got packed away and started the brutal ascent of Meall a Coire Cruinn, one of the many peaks that rise up almost vertically out of the sea level loch. It was a tough clamber up heathery and grassy slopes, weaving hither and thither to avoid bands of crags, but the reward of attaining the ridge was seeing a white-tailed sea eagle take off and sweep down into the gloom of a coire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ege1Gk" title="Slopes of Meall nan Creag Leac by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slopes of Meall nan Creag Leac" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8274/8704924219_95e1c329a4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind me the view over the loch to the rough peaks of Moidart was stunning and now ahead of me I was faced with the alpine north-west face of Sgurr Ghiubhsachain, the Corbett which had dominated the head of Cona Glen the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ege864" title="P1060789 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1060789" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8399/8704945721_178e1dbdf0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge was a jumble of crags and rocks but it was possible to thread a route through all this and only the final ascent to the summit shoulder was truly steep. For this I donned microspikes and shouldered my axe but the snow was soft and didn’t pose any problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emerged to glorious views down Cona Glen all the way to Nevis and the Mamores. The final slope was a joyous scramble and then I was at the huge summit cairn under blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egk47s" title="Summit slopes of Sgurr Ghiubhsachain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit slopes of Sgurr Ghiubhsachain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8132/8706103018_ba2f2442d2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views were incredible in all directions, not only to the Lochaber peaks near at hand, but further off to Creag Meagaidh, the Monadh Liath, and then towards Loch Arkaig and the peaks of Knoydart. In the south the land stretched out to the sea and in the distance the dark shape of Ben More on Mull stood out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egkeyC" title="South from Sgurr Ghiubhsachain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="South from Sgurr Ghiubhsachain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8414/8706138176_13403c9d82_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long break here I carried on my traverse of the hill, following easy ridge south to the next top of Meall nan lice. This offered more glorious views down Loch Shiel and also served as a good spot for lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egevLp" title="Cona Glen from Sgurr Ghiubhsachain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cona Glen from Sgurr Ghiubhsachain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8415/8705022011_7a14ae41dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I dropped down some very steep slopes to the low bealach above the head of Cona Glen and then picked my way up the ridge of Drum Tarsuinn heading for my second Corbett of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egkuNb" title="Upper Cona Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Upper Cona Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8116/8706189422_99a33c09a8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the easier gradient there were still a few crags to manoeuvre around but the summit of Drum Tarsuinn (called Stob a' Bhealach an Sgriodain by the OS) brought the reward of yet more views. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further on I crossed my final top of the trip on Meall Mòr, stopping to look down to Cona Glen and then to Lochan Dubh nestled before Glen Scaddle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a sustained drop down to the next bealach, during which I stopped to chat to a couple over from Fort William for a few nights, and then it was down incredibly steep slopes to reach the shores of Lochan Dubh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egfjgi" title="Lochan Dubh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan Dubh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8705178431_4aae731c01_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent was pathless except for very faint traces in the upper reaches and soon it became prudent just to carefully pick out the most likely way down and follow it, poles clutched tightly in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egm5qm" title="Lochan Dubh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan Dubh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8557/8706302532_170e70138b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down by the lochan it was warmer and I stopped for a final break looking along the waters which were starting to be ruffled by that promised westerly wind. From here I made my way along the shore, occasionally picking up a track but more often than not boghopping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egm8ph" title="Gleann an Lochain Duibh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gleann an Lochain Duibh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8706312562_2e53bb927a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the lochan the track became clearer and this made progress down into Glen Scaddle much quicker. As I reached the glen a footbridge took me across the burn and at the point where the two waters met I found an idyllic stretch of grass to pitch the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egfrAX" title="Camped in Glen Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camped in Glen Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8407/8705203119_7c12f21818_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tent up I spent a time lazing in the sunshine. Unfortunately I soon found out that the idyllic site was also a bit of a hit with the local ticks. After evicting these from my trousers and noticing that big black clouds had gathered in the west I retired to the tent for dinner (super noodles, pasta, cheese, salami followed by tea and dark chocolate). By 8pm it was raining, hard, and so I resigned myself to an evening in the tent, reading some Murakami and listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egftqc" title="River Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8113/8705209223_724c8e6635_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egikyc" title="River Scaddle at dusk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Scaddle at dusk" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8557/8705768111_20da3a38e5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain continued pretty constantly all night. At around 7 it slackened off and I roused myself with a mocha. As I was about to peer outside the tent it came on again harder than ever so I spent another hour reading. I packed everything up in the tent and then headed outside. Both rivers were now raging past and I soon got the tent away and strapped to the handy carry loops on the bottom of the pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egp6QW" title="Wild Camping by the Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping by the Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8417/8706892658_2f054c07c5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather once I got going wasn’t actually too bad and with a nice easy walk down the glen ahead of me and the wind behind I made good progress. Occasional pauses to look back confirmed that there was plenty of dramatic weather in the hills today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eginfD" title="River Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8550/8705773821_edc5dd6801_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the LRT crossing I took to the opposite bank of the river but then, rather than following the track as it headed into the forest, I attempted to follow the path marked on the OS map running close to the river. This proved a bit of a mistake as the path was very “aspirational” and I spent more time hopping along the firm riverbank than I did following its course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/egpaJS" title="River in Upper Glen Scaddle by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River in Upper Glen Scaddle" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8121/8706905762_39c8ec4c85_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t bad though (although the path on the north bank is much firmer and clear as far as I could see) and I eventually rejoined the LRT for the final stretch through Glen Scaddle and back to the car. Although it rained off and on I got back largely dry. The glen had been dramatic with waterfalls raging down the high coires to the south and the high peaks behind shrouded in cloud with occasional bursts of blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After getting changed it was then a short drive down to the ferry which I missed thanks to a motley group of new born lambs and their mothers who were sauntering their way into Ardgour. A half hour later though I was across and soon driving back east through all sorts of weather to finally make it back to Aberdeen after a rewarding weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrapped up in my down sleeping bag on my incredibly comfy air bed, itself resting on wonderfully soft mountain turf, I was at first very confused about where I was and what my alarm was doing going off at the uncivilised hour of 4am. Then it came back to me, I was camped just a short distance away from the summit of a Munro. A few minutes spent outside the tent around midnight had shown a clear sky which promised great things for the dawn. Reluctantly I unzipped my bag and sleepily dragged my clothes back on. Stifling a yawn I unzipped the inner of my tent and peered out. The pre-dawn sky was a deep indigo with bands of red cloud sitting just above the golden haze of the horizon. My legs were objecting to more physical exercise so soon after a twenty mile day but I cajoled them into action and we got up to the summit cairn of Beinn Eibhinn just in time to see the sun peek above the eastern hills. The quality and colour of the light was just staggering and I spent a happy half hour wandering around snapping photos and breathing in this utterly magical time of day. In a cruel season of wet and windy weather this was truly a summer morning to savour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mamores, Ben Nevis and a vast sweep of the southern Highlands around to the Lawers Range were red in the early light and closer too the peaks of yesterday, Aonach Beag and Gael-Charn, stood darkly silhouetted against the rising sun. Slightly further off the humpback of Ben Alder was a fiery heap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day began and the light shifted to more natural colours I dropped back down the tent, my body ready for caffeine and a dose of sugary oats. The stove was fired up and I soon had a coffee and porridge in hand. Although I had a the possibility of another full day ahead of me, I was keen to get back home mid-afternoon and so got myself packed up soon after breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had scoped the ridge immediately north of the campsite the evening before and after filling up my bottle with more snowmelt I descended the easy slopes towards the western end of An Lairig. As I approached the lower slopes the terrain got a little steeper and a little boggier but without too much trouble I was down and standing besides the still waters of Loch Guilbhinn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With minimal water at height I had resolved to complete my morning ablutions down at the loch and so here I washed and brushed my teeth. The waters were incredibly still, the hills above Strath Ossian and the Munro of Chno Dearg framed in perfect symmetry. At one point I startled a small fish out of the water and had some trouble encouraging it back into the loch…! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a cereal bar taken sitting besides the loch I made my way down its eastern shore towards Strath Ossian. It may be possible to cut off this large diversion by wading across the Abhainn Ghuilbhinn near the northern end of the loch but I was in no rush and so took the longer, dryer way around. I passed a small boat pulled up on the shore and then was heading along and amongst the glacial moraines into Strath Ossian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I intended to cross the River Ossian by way of the vehicle bridge. When I reached it however it appeared that bridge maintenance was being undertaken and had perhaps been interrupted by the Jubilee Weekend. New planks stretched from the far side to approximately three quarter distance, and then stopped. On my side there were just the bare, widely spaced girders. I very cautiously made my way across and it was with a great deal of relief that I reached the planks. After this it was a gentle climb on the track up above Strathossian House which enjoyed beautiful views back to Beinn Eibhinn and Strath Ossian and up towards the summit of Chno Dearg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the planning stage I had thought about heading over Chno Dearg and the other Loch Treig Munro which now lay between me and Fersit but the weather forecast for Tuesday had been for a marked deterioration and I didn't want to get caught high if it turned. I was also quite happy with the lower level route which would take me more gently back to the car. Despite this being a private route and it being holiday Tuesday of the Jubilee Celebrations there was quite a bit of traffic on the "road" including what looked to be holiday cars presumably going to Loch Ossian to stay there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happily I soon left the "road" and took the footpath which climbs up and over the low shoulder of Chno Dearg with find views back towards the Aonach Beag group and forward to Creag Meagaidh above Glen Spean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually you drop down into a quite dense wood which is quite a novelty on a Scottish hill walk. After the exposed hillside it was very different in amongst the gloom of the pines and the ruined cottage was a little spooky even with the sun rising overhead - I'm glad I didn't walk out this way on an evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon came across a Scottish Rights of Way way marker and after this the forest itself came to an end with me standing above a lumpy stretch of countryside that angled gently down towards the River Treig and my car parked at Fersit. The blue skies were fading rapidly and ominous looking clouds were gathering as I made my way through the boggy flatlands to reach the farm track that would guide me through the scattered settlement of Fersit. Across the river and up the far bank and it was with some relief that I saw my car still parked where I had left it a couple of days earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had taken me four hours from the summit of Beinn Eibhinn to get back to Fersit and thanks to my early start it wasn't even midday yet. This gave me the opportunity for a relaxed drive back east stopping for coffee in Newtonmore and finally getting back to Aberdeen mid afternoon where I had thankfully missed much of the Jubilee shenanigans. Sadly though the bank holiday was being observed by the fish &amp;amp; chip shop and so the celebratory meal was slightly modified in deference to the Queen and my gratitude for the three days of perfect Jubilee weather.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry></feed>
