&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 14th March 2016&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 7.7km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 551m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 2hrs 15mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Ben Rinnes (Corbett, 841m)       &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny with a cold northwesterly wind  &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/229"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day off work with no plans and a grand looking weather forecast for the east side of the country. I decided to finally head into Moray and climb the Corbett of Ben Rinnes, a distinctive hill that stands slightly isolated from the higher hills of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed to Dufftown and then along the winding whisky road past Glenfiddich and so on, turning onto the minor road which winds up and over the hills to Speyside. There is a good parking area and the good weather had brought quite a few folk out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25890688885/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Ben Rinnes Car Park"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1604/25890688885_a6c837ed54_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Rinnes Car Park"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much ado I was off up the vehicle track which climbs up the heather lower slopes of the hill. Height is gained quickly and soon there were good views off the hills around Glen Livet and closer by to neighbouring Meikle Conval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25769933952/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Towards Glen Livet"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1688/25769933952_6d77a5acd2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Glen Livet"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25590164080/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Meikle Conval"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1450/25590164080_765e896106_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meikle Conval"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hill was quite busy and I caught and passed a few people heading up, whilst also saying hello to those descending. The sunshine was marvellous and I felt like one of the first truly springlike days in the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25890791585/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="The track to Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1650/25890791585_fb53d3a6b2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The track to Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25258072414/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="The Convals"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1696/25258072414_fc318d45ec_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The Convals"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn’t anything particularly remarkable about the ascent of Ben Rinnes. The well-trodden track is clear all the way up, changing from a wide vehicle track to a footpath as the final summit cone is reached. There were good views off to the north across the rolling land of Moray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25590280880/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1697/25590280880_e2f02eb302_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The light was hazy, possibly with muirburn, but the higher hills of the Cairngorms could just about be made out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25258243824/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Towards Dufftown"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1532/25258243824_fb7e7f3ef8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Dufftown"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I reached the summit where there are some tors, a trig and a viewfinder. Despite all the people on the path I had the place to myself and I enjoyed the views from the trig before finding a place in the lee of the wind to sit and have lunch. With the sun beating down it was exceptionally warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25796121761/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Ben Rinnes Summit Trig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1646/25796121761_9f922cce29_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ben Rinnes Summit Trig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the distance I could see the darker surface of the Moray firth and off to the west the Cairngorms were visible through the haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25262513103/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Northeast from Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1569/25262513103_a4f845717a_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Northeast from Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25770531402/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Glen Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1455/25770531402_16fc3732d2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long break on the summit I gathered my things and headed off. I could have extended the walk to take in some more of the uplands but had decided instead to get back down to the car and head up to the coast at Portsoy to see the Bowfiddle Rock. As I left the summit I came across a wintry ptarmigan pair playing around the remaining snowpatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25590809860/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Ptarmigan pair on Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1489/25590809860_f5b16699a2_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Ptarmigan pair on Ben Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retracing my steps gave me an opportunity to take in the expansive views again as I followed the track down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25590823900/in/album-72157666046716466/" title="Glen Rinnes"&gt;&lt;img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1450/25590823900_ed9edb1c85_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glen Rinnes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much drama I was back at the car and after a refreshment snack headed north towards the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 10th October 2015&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 35.9km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,303m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Bynack More (Munro, 1,090m), Creag Mhor (Corbett, 895m)      &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny with a cool breeze and occassional shower                     &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/92"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blush pink sky rapidly turned into a fiery sunrise as the red sun rose through a pale mist clinging to the rooftops and spires of Aberdeen. Early on Saturday it was a quick drive around to Coylumbridge and then along the ski centre access road passing the utterly still waters of Loch Morlich, the northern corries reflected in its dark waters, before pulling into the Allt Mor parking area just beyond the Glenmore Lodge turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few midges buzzing around the car park so I was soon off, picking up a track that seemed to be leading in the right direction. Unfortunately I soon came to the banks of the Allt Mor itself with no bridge in sight. The water was swift but relatively shallow so I decided to wade across to the far side where the path I wanted to be on ran below the pines. Later on I would find that in my rush to escape the midges I had taken the wrong exit out of the car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was overcast and a little chilly at this stage but it was a delight to be back on the footpaths of the Rothiemurchas Forest, deserted at this hour of the day. Everything felt damp and autumnal, accentuated by the still air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the narrow footpath wound its way past the rifle range and deposited me on the excellent track running from Glenmore Lodge towards the Ryvoan Pass. I took this and after a short time came to An Lochan Uaine, the green lochan, which sits in the middle of the pass, reflecting the green colour of the surrounding trees. Like Morlich, its waters were utterly still and a I wandered along the sandy, north bank to the far end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22007334304/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="An Lochan Uaine"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/634/22007334304_eae26e33b6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="An Lochan Uaine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22616581712/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="An Lochan Uaine"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/22616581712_37111e5ddb_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="An Lochan Uaine"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had rejoined it, the good track swept me along, out of the pass and across the undulating terrain that separates Ryvoan from Strath Nethy. At the River Nethy I thought I’d have a sit by the stream and drink a cup of tea. However, a few seconds in and the midges had already found me so I drank up and hurried on, starting the long climb up to the high moorland to the north of Bynack More.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22630144995/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Cobwebs and Heather"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/625/22630144995_55299371bd_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Cobwebs and Heather"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22009094823/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Strath Nethy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5631/22009094823_5ed66cb5f9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Strath Nethy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22007541004/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Meall a&amp;#x27; Buchaille above Ryvoan"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5626/22007541004_baba89818d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Meall a&amp;#x27; Buchaille above Ryvoan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed a couple just as we reached the top of the climb and then made my way southward to Bynack More. Off to the east it looked like brighter conditions still prevailed closer to the coast but westward towards the Monadhliath there were signs of more defined clouds than the grey sheet sitting above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22641547941/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Bynack More and Bynack Beag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/571/22641547941_24c3c177e4_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Bynack More and Bynack Beag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way up the final ridge to the Munro summit, occasionally leaving the path to scramble up sections of blocky granite. Over on Bynack Beag I watched a party of three climb up from Strath Nethy and make their way towards the main summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22616917372/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="The ridge to Bynack More"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/659/22616917372_1447184984_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The ridge to Bynack More"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite only having seen a handful of people since leaving the car, I emrged to find quite a busy summit of Bynack More with people sitting around eating lunch or taking photos at the cairn. I found myself a nice rock to perch on, gazing off to the peaks of Ben Macdui, Beinn Mheadhoin and Cairngorm itself whilst I had a snack and some water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearby I overheard a group discussing how they would get up on to Cairngorm. Having done the &lt;a href="/blog/2010/08/bynack-more-and-cairn-gorm/"&gt;same thing myself back in 2010&lt;/a&gt; I shared my knowledge of the good stalker’s path that rises up from the Saddle and then headed off to bag Bynack Beag, the lower Munro Top situated to the west of the main summit. This involved a steep descent down to the col and then a gentle climb up to the top which is marked by an easily surmounted tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22007901314/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Bynack More from Bynack Beag"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/720/22007901314_38f0605811_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Bynack More from Bynack Beag"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I wandered generally southward, crossing the stream of the Allt a' Choire Dheirg and then handrailing the edge above Strath Nethy as I made my way up to A’ Choinneach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22617181642/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Below Bynack More"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/690/22617181642_a3f8728a80_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Below Bynack More"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this off-path excursion I picked up the stalker’s path which dropped me down to the Saddle. At this point the day brightened and it seemed like the sun might actually come out. The burnt orange of the late season heather looked stunning and I enjoyed the views up the astonishingly still water of Loch Avon towards Shelter Stone crag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22617727992/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Loch Avon and the Saddle"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5677/22617727992_6812584fb9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Avon and the Saddle"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Saddle I turned and dropped down a muddy, blocky path to the east end of the loch where I found a nice place to stop for a proper lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22605331036/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5628/22605331036_b65b8b9d8d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was utterly still and silent and even the midges were less persistent here as I sat gazing out over the glassy waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22008715674/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5754/22008715674_c46e7eea58_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22605516366/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5707/22605516366_e8efd65f5b_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of folks with large backpacks came down from the Saddle and crossed the infant River Avon behind me. I stayed a while longer, wandering up and down the beach before finally packing up and setting off back to the eastward path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22008920114/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Outflow of Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5693/22008920114_ef97e9de18_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Outflow of Loch Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This follows the north bank of the River Avon and was very boggy and unpleasant in places. The views to the big hills around Loch Avon receded behind me and ahead there were the rolling shoulders of Beinn a’ Bhuird and Ben Avon beyond the remnants of the glacial moraine above the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22443772690/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Looking down the infant River Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/705/22443772690_6b1602300e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Looking down the infant River Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22642961341/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="River Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5653/22642961341_de022400fb_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="River Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I neared the ford of Avon and the refuge I spotted the backpackers setting up their tents on top of the moiraine. At the shelter I stopped for a nosy about the recently refurbished interior and check out the crossing of the river which looked fairly easy today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22443878580/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Approaching the Fords of Avon"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5651/22443878580_6ea7cf38d6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Approaching the Fords of Avon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22618370812/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Inside the Fords of Avon Refuge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5637/22618370812_7e0defa14d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Inside the Fords of Avon Refuge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I turned my back on the Avon and picked up the Lairig an Laoigh track heading north. A short while after the track crossed the Allt Dearg and then I left the path to climb up the southwestern shoulder of the Corbett Creag Mhor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22009267414/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Allt Dearg and Bynack More"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5646/22009267414_64f8e22ebe_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Allt Dearg and Bynack More"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial boggy, steep ground relented and I found a stony but easy angled rise up to the first of several rocky tops on this long south-north running hill. The next one was the high point, crowned by a tor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22619697222/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Bynack More from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/741/22619697222_8f74a15fba_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Bynack More from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22445343660/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Feith Bhuidhe from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/730/22445343660_dfd84787e8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Feith Bhuidhe from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22445361350/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Summit of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5798/22445361350_7669649597_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way across to it I came across a small shelter stone which had been augmented with a dry stone wall outside it – very cosy. I reached the summit, scrambling up the final granite section to be greeted by expansive views across the eastern Cairngorms. The earlier threat of sunshine had failed to materialise and it felt cooler now despite the continuing lack of wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22633750035/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="From the summit of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/675/22633750035_9c5123ed19_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="From the summit of Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22633468145/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="East from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/750/22633468145_43efe9e8b1_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="East from Creag Mhor"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the top and rapidly dropped down an increasingly steep slope westward back to the Lairig track, an easy landmark as it wound brightly amongst the dull, brown landscape. As I reached the ford crossing of the upper Glasath a couple came down with backpacking packs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22011131994/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Glasath"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/764/22011131994_5971ec4def_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Glasath"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saying hello to them I followed the path up the hill they had descended, finding myself walking along below the summit ridge of Bynack More. The path dipped down at the crossing of the Uisge Dubh Poll a' Choin and then rose again back up to meet the Munro track. It was peaceful on this section, looking down to the head of the Caplich water and a vast area of uninhabited land leading the eye towards the distant hills around Glenlivet and the Ladder area. As I stood looking out on this a phalanx of geese, in a huge V, passed by, their honking a distant but unmistakable sound of autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the meeting of the tracks I had a final snack break and then made my way off the hill. The constructed track made going easy and I was overtaken by a couple of hillrunners as I was making my way down. The light slowly changed as the afternoon advanced. The midges were still out by the Nethy so I headed for Ryvoan and a final stop by the still waters of An Lochan Uaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22013535843/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Towards Nethy Bridge"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/751/22013535843_b7db597194_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards Nethy Bridge"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a slightly different route back to the car which sensible avoided any fording of the Allt Mor. As I was walking along through the forest I was thinking about rewilding and the exciting possibility of glimpsing a lynx through the trees. Just then there was a crackling of branches and a dark shape ran across the path in front of me. My heart started pounding as I crept cautiously forward but when I reached the same point a look into the trees to the left showed the bounding shape of a deer disappearing off into the woods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/22012040074/in/album-72157659722709595/" title="Geese"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/777/22012040074_e36fc7acfd_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Geese"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mountain biker overtook me near the car park and after a final stroll through the Rothiemurchas I was back for just after 6pm. A couple of hours later and I was back in Aberdeen, tucking into a fish supper with a bottle of beer and a feeling of great satisfaction after a long day in the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="daywalk"></category><category term="dayhike"></category><category term="ryvoan"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="bynack more"></category></entry><entry><title>The Hills of the Pitfichie Forest</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2015/01/pitfichie-forest/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-18T17:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-01-18T17:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2015-01-18:/blog/2015/01/pitfichie-forest/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A short wintry hike over the hills of the Pitfichie Forest in eastern Aberdeenshire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 18th January 2015&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 14.7km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 491m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Green Hill, Cairn William, Pitfichie Hill&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunshine and snow showers                 &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some interesting maneuvers by the coach driver on the access road we were off the coach and heading up to the car park and then on to the start of the Pitifichie forest cycleway. Under a thin cover of snow this offered an easy walk uphill with just a couple of the more hardy mountain bikers overtaking us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16127942948" title="Cut logs near Tillyfourie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7581/16127942948_148ea22b53_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cut logs near Tillyfourie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under a brightening winter sky we followed the track up to the circle of stones near Whitehills farm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun was rising over a hazy scene of fields and woods as we followed the cycle track around a corner and up to a branch where a minor path headed off towards Green Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695623103" title="Open views near Whitehills Farm by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15695623103_bd8104fe0e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Open views near Whitehills Farm"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695643653" title="Looking across Aberdeenshire by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7486/15695643653_1da8dbe2a7_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Looking across Aberdeenshire"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound our way on a pleasant track up through the woods enjoying the increasing sunshine as the cloud broke and disappeared away to the east. We arrived at the summit of Green Hill just as the sun made a final determined appearance, lighting up the long ridge of Cairn William and the whole of Vale of Alford spread out below us to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16129350969" title="Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7520/16129350969_2192d6efed_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128150910" title="Alford from Green Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7516/16128150910_2b918fc574_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Alford from Green Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128157150" title="Winter Sunshine, Green Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8572/16128157150_c1db5b6083_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Winter Sunshine, Green Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path continued beyond the cairn and offered a fun descent as it followed the contours of the hill between stretches of heather and small conifers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16289619016" title="Descending Green Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7554/16289619016_ffe2e42fb2_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Descending Green Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped for a longer pause in the shelter of the trees back on the main cycle track. The blue skies looked to be shortlived as large snow-carrying clouds now appeared in from the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16129388309" title="Approaching snow at Point 6 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8596/16129388309_032549d205_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Approaching snow at Point 6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the main track through the forest, climbing up through the dense pines as snow started to fall heavily. It was a magical atmosphere though hoods were pulled tight around faces as the headwind blew flakes straight into our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a turn off we left the main track and started the enjoyable climb up to the ridge of Cairn William following another well constructed cycle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128189130" title="The path up Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/16128189130_050362de57_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The path up Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695698243" title="On the ascent of Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8628/15695698243_4b40c28edb_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="On the ascent of Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we gained height the snow eased and blue skies appeared again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695701343" title="Blue skies appearing over Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7535/15695701343_e820f9c74c_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Blue skies appearing over Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were dramatic views across the lower Aberdeenshire countryside as rays of light broke through the slow moving clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16129408999" title="Snow showers from Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7528/16129408999_3f917ef9f6_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Snow showers from Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We emerged onto the broad-backed Cairn William ridge and were immediately greeted by the sight of Bennachie, its flanks fletched with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16289655876" title="Bennachie from Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7491/16289655876_f76d6ce715_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Bennachie from Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15693183794" title="On Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7500/15693183794_6ce3e248d0_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="On Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128232380" title="On Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7488/16128232380_8a4f5020da_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="On Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridge path was easy to follow, though there a couple of slips as below a thin layer of ice the path had been turned into a glassy stream of thick, hardened and polished ice. More often than not it as safer walking in the heather, especially when we got to some of the broader granite sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695737653" title="Light rays from Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7492/15695737653_1f9227e41e_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Light rays from Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16315625445" title="Sentry stone on Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8603/16315625445_aac0fd3c03_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Sentry stone on Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We slipped and slided our way along to the summit where a wide expanse of glassy rocks is supplemented with a trig point. The views were excellent from the top and there was an opportunity to regroup as folk looked out towards the surrounding hills and down towards a hazy Aberdeen off in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128080998" title="The summit of Cairn William by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7568/16128080998_b2928ae043_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="The summit of Cairn William"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track zig-zags its way downhill but given the continuing presence of glassy ice we chose to cut straight downhill to rejoin the main cycle track below Pitfichie Hill. Here a few folk stopped for a break whilst the rest found the junction up Pitfichie and headed for the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128299010" title="Ascending Pitfichie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8607/16128299010_2b678d053b_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Ascending Pitfichie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left beyond the marker and headed up the final short plod to the summit of Pitfichie Hill where there were expansive views all around, back to Cairn William and further off to the hills of Aberdeenshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15695802953" title="Cairn William from Pitfichie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7521/15695802953_e87c846094_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Cairn William from Pitfichie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16128133518" title="Northwest from Pitfichie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7583/16128133518_75cdddda52_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Northwest from Pitfichie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15693271824" title="Summit of Pitfichie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15693271824_5bf3e6c343_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Summit of Pitfichie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/15693273954" title="Summit of Pitfichie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7548/15693273954_18dccefc7f_c.jpg" width="800" height="600" alt="Summit of Pitfichie Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit was once again more like a skating rink so after pausing for the view and photos we headed back the way we had come, making a rapid descent to the cycle track and then following it northward to a point back in the trees where we stopped for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there was sunshine during the lunch break as we were moving off the light dimmed and we were once again under cold grey skies that, as we headed round the east side of Pitfichie Hill, turned to snow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/16314847452" title="Snow Falling by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/16314847452_354ea0ce0b_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="Snow Falling"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There weren’t many more pauses now and it wasn’t until we had threaded our way down to the road near Monymusk that the sun came out. We trooped down the short stretch of tarmac into the village where there was a hospitable welcome (and Deeside Brewery ale) at the hotel there. A very enjoyable winter day out on a pleasant little cluster of local hills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="aberdeenshire"></category><category term="pitfichie"></category></entry><entry><title>Mona Gowan and Morven</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2014/04/morven-mona-gowan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-04-12T22:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2014-04-12T22:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2014-04-12:/blog/2014/04/morven-mona-gowan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A loop from the west taking in Mona Gowan and Morven on a bright and breezy spring day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 12th April 2014&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 28.34km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,007m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Mona Gowan (Graham), Morven (Corbett)          &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very breezy with plenty of sunshine               &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/225"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was blowing an absolute hoolie when I parked up in the modest sized layby besides the A939 above Glen Gairn. I got my stuff sorted in the shelter of the boot but even so there was still a danger of losing stuff as anything loose blew wildly around. Still, there was sunshine and fast moving clouds and it felt good to be back in trail shoes with a view of hills all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14087745533" title="Tom Dubh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tom Dubh" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/14087745533_771c659a1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just to be a fairly quick round, taking in the Graham of Mona Gowan and the Corbett of Morven which dominates the north side of Deeside as you approach Ballater from the east. A short stretch along the road leads to a vehicle track heading off towards Glen Fenzie. This was followed a short way to a ruined cottage where I turned north to follow the easy track up Tom Dubh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14067723395" title="A939 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="A939" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2903/14067723395_ce8b6e598e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the quick, bright air the views were fantastic and soon I was looking behind me towards Mount Keen and Lochnagar, snow streaking their northern edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14087994953" title="Lochnagar beyond the A939 and Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar beyond the A939 and Glen Gairn" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/14087994953_be25942dc8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gained height easily and was soon looking across the watershed towards Strathdon. The wind increased height and it was very difficult to walk in a straight line as it cut through the heather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14068479344" title="Towards Strathdon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Strathdon" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2921/14068479344_476e9e7a11_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the top of Tom Dubh a line of fence posts led me eastward first to the cairned summit of Scraulac with views back to Ben Avon and the eastern Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14068569074" title="Summit of Scraulac by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Scraulac" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7185/14068569074_5086ef2c3c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I could now look eastward along the ridge to Cairnagour Hill and then Morven in the distance commanding a lofty position above the lower hills of middle Deeside. In the far distance Bennachie was a dark outline amongst the rolling green hills of Aberdeenshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14088214433" title="Mona Gowan and Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairnagour Hill and Morven" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/14088214433_025137983d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the strong wind to my back and a good track winding its way through short cropped heather it was easy progress to Cairnagour Hill, the views of Morven drawing me forward as bright sunshine picked out hazy details. A guy and his dog passed me briefly but I overtook them again on the long pull up to the featureless summit of Cairnagour Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885160409" title="Deeside Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deeside Hills" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7431/13885160409_4a797bb551_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were panoramic views across Deeside to Lochngar now resplendent in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885196670" title="Lochnagar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/13885196670_ea5db2e438_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was now a reasonable dip to the bealach before Morven though it was nice to be sheltered briefly from the wind and I took the opportunity to lose a layer and change out my hats. Then it was a long pull back up to the summit of Mona Gowan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14048705616" title="Mona Gowan and Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mona Gowan and Morven" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2898/14048705616_025c974c7e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substantial cairn on Mona Gowan was reached after passing through a gate in the fence. The wind was severe up here and after taking a few shaky photos I huddled down in the lee of the cairn for a drink and some food, looking east to Morven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885249587" title="Morven from Mona Gowan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morven from Mona Gowan" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7335/13885249587_4372fa097c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again it was nice to drop off to the east to find some shelter but the ridge extending east towards the Slack of Glencarvie was soon exposing me to the wind again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14068733291" title="Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morven" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7358/14068733291_b1b1db75d6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the opportunity of shelter above the Slack to enjoy lunch, lazing around in the pleasant sunshine. It felt pretty springlike. After this I dropped down into the Slack and scrambled up the far side, emerging back on the ridge where I found the wind to be more ferocious then ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked my way along to the cairned summit of Mullacdubh but was soon descending as it was impossible to stand in the teeth of the wind. The views of Morven were beautiful from this side and I was soon starting the ascent up onto its western shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wind it was fight to get up the final slopes and it was a relief to gain the summit of the Corbett and find some shelter in the big windbreak behind the cairn. The views again were spectacular, a wide panorama of hills and landscape from the sea to the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885775739" title="Summit of Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Morven" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/13885775739_5a9b74f13d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some more food it was time to be heading down. The wind wasn't showing any sign of easing and from now on I'd be walking into it to get back to the car. My plan was to descend south from Morven and pick up the track that runs west to Glen Fenzie. The strong winds made the going quite tortuous on the upper slopes and I ended up angling across to the reach the relative shelter of a burn dropping down to the southwest of Morven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The going was mostly easy, stopping beside a chattering burn to refill my water bottle and then picking my way through scrubby bushes to finally reach the track running to the south of Morven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885875347" title="Towards Mount Keen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Mount Keen" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7445/13885875347_de190dda1e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track offered easy footing but it was hard work walking into the wind. The views were still good though and soon I was dropping down towards the wide bowl south of Mona Gowan where Morven Lodge and its associated farms sits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13885921067" title="Track westward towards Morven Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track westward towards Morven Lodge" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/13885921067_b25b6511af_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked my way through the maze of tracks, crossed the Morven Burn and then skirted the boundary of Morven Lodge to reach the track running up the hillside on the far side of the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13823935805" title="Morven from Morven Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morven from Morven Lodge" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2933/13823935805_04825d1a15_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then a case of following the track across the lower slopes of Tom Liath before dropping into Glen Fenzie, crossing another burn and then dropping down past the ruin to the road and then the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/14069431082" title="Glen Fenzie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Fenzie" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7300/14069431082_7e2a22fd75_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a great day out on the hills, despite the ever present and at times maddening wind. I also took some video footage and have put together this 10 minute film which captures a bit more of the wind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 1st March 2014&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 29.2km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 801m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Carn a' Mhaim [Munro]&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very cold, windy, snow storms&lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/228"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of wind and rain had put a damper on any form of enjoyable winter hillwalking cabin fever was setting in and I was desperate to get out, even if getting up high wasn’t going to be all that practical. A loop walk I’ve wanted to do for a while now is the classic three glens walk from the Linn of Dee, heading through Glen Lui, Glen Luibeg and returning via Glen Dee. With a reasonable forecast for the Cairngorms I decided it was about time I got out and did something and so this route was chosen as a good way to cover some miles with the added bonus of a possible Munro if the conditions looked favourable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set off from the car park with a spring in my step. Despite early March and the long winter, there was a hint of sunshine and spring warmth in the air. This of course lasted until the first snow shower came over Sgor Dubh and passed through Glen Lui some way behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13010750745" title="Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/13010750745_3b830703be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13010996633" title="Snow shower over Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3221/13010996633_20cd6836ec_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Snow shower over Glen Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed Derry Lodge and was soon winding my way along the good track through Glen Luibeg. There were tantalising glimpses ahead of snow-plastered mountains deep in the heart of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011388584" title="The Luibeg Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2116/13011388584_1ab6ee3f5e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Luibeg Burn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hopped across the boulders downstream of the Luibeg Bridge and after the steep climb away from the water got views north up the upper Luibeg towards the cliffs and slopes surrounding Coire Sputan Dearg on this side of the Macdui plateau. Through a chink in the wintry-grey clouds some sunshine was spilling through but it was a fleeting glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I gained the high point of the path the western Cairngorms swung into view, Beinn Bhrotain and its subsidiary tops plastered in fresh snow. The skies were darkening but there was enough promise of clear views to tempt me up the path towards Carn a’ Mhaims summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011137215" title="Beinn Bhrotain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/13011137215_b418bc93c2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Beinn Bhrotain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Height was gained quickly on the good track and I was soon looking back down Glen Lui eastward and across Glen Dee to the Bhrotain plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011570874" title="Beinn Bhrotain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/13011570874_28d45b1b2c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Beinn Bhrotain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011367293" title="Looking back down Glen Luibeg and Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3200/13011367293_70b38ea121_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking back down Glen Luibeg and Glen Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too quickly the conditions deteriorated and by the time I was on the snowy upper slopes I had crampons on, ice axe in hand and was plodding uphill following a compass bearing. Visibility came and went and luckily improved just as I crested the rise close to the summit. Suddenly I had views of cloud breaking over Glen Dee and my first glimpse of the Devil’s Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011413753" title="Snow over Glen Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3553/13011413753_15ab0808bc_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Snow over Glen Dee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011290105" title="First view of the Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7326/13011290105_e63d3ef732_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="First view of the Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the ridge up towards the summit, conscious that the weather could change again, and was glad that my efforts to get up to Munro level were being rewarded with a few views of these wonderful hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/12886443034" title="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point from Carn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/12886443034_712f6f7630_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point from Carn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached the summit and enjoyed a few moments where I could still see around me. It was cold and strong, gusting wind was blowing across the tops. I wrapped up and watched as the next stormy system billowed over Beinn Bhrotain and leapt across Glen Dee towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/12864775534" title="Looking across to The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/12864775534_2aa4c801ef_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Looking across to The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011525075" title="Winter storm over Beinn Bhrotain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7423/13011525075_df7fa66eaa_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Winter storm over Beinn Bhrotain"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011941524" title="Cloud over the Cairn Toul massif by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/13011941524_51ff8ab133_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cloud over the Cairn Toul massif"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storm was tight knit and focussed. The major bulk of it passed to the south, slipping into Glen Lui. I caught the edge of it, winds throwing volleys of hail my way. I put my goggles on and carefully retraced my steps. Had the weather held I might have gone along the ridge and descended into Glen Dee from the bealach before Macdui but getting lower quicker seemed much more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011684995" title="Summit of Cairn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2386/13011684995_6904965c47_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Cairn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011872673" title="Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7414/13011872673_81c3978d91_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the compass, I went across to the south top and then descended the upper slopes, soon joining my outward tracks and following these back down to the path. As I descended I emerged from the cloud and had views back down Glen Lui. I cut a corner by descending heather slopes and was soon enough on the Glen Dee track heading westward to continue the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011806145" title="Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3810/13011806145_458455540d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Lui"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13011836565" title="South from Cairn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7377/13011836565_61f7fe8e18_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="South from Cairn a&amp;#x27; Mhaim"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was blue sky emerging once again as I turned the corner into Glen Dee and suddenly had grand views ahead towards the Lairig Ghru. There appeared to be another storm coming over Cairn Toul, leaving the Devil’s Point illuminated by sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012367064" title="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3006/13012367064_ddcba2f77f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012058495" title="Clouds over Cairn Toul by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3736/13012058495_5279a2ff54_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Clouds over Cairn Toul"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued along the track until I was just below the Devil’s Point and here met the path which heads south following the line of the River Dee. Ahead the Lairig Ghru was looking mysterious and enticing, snow-wreathed and majestic and it was with a certain regret that I turned and began to follow the path alongside the Dee in a southerly direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012826804" title="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/13012826804_dac5dca6d4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Devil&amp;#x27;s Point"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012398753" title="Towards the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7344/13012398753_65f5231c6a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards the Lairig Ghru"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012306443" title="Cairn Toul by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3125/13012306443_87767e2386_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cairn Toul"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I retraced my steps it was clear that more snow showers were passing over the Lairig and onto Carn a’ Mhaim. I was glad I wasn’t still up high, battling along the ridge or picking my way down by the Tailor’s Burn at this moment. The track wends its way down some way from the river but the surface is good and I made easy progress in more benign conditions. The views changed until I was looking back at the long side view of the Devil’s Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13012865324" title="Storm in Glen Geusachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2366/13012865324_ce047c4f0a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Storm in Glen Geusachan"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually these views receded and as I moved into lower down Glen Dee I finally found both the bank of the river and some sunshine. Here I had a pleasant mid-afternoon break on a rock enjoying the quiet. I still hadn’t seen a single other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/13009716295" title="Glen Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7354/13009716295_9f7a920823_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Dee"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I was soon back on familiar ground, passing the Chest of Dee, and then Whitebridge and strolling back down to the Linn of Dee as the sun sank lower in the March sky. It had been an altogether excellent little outing, peaceful, good views and the Cairngorms all to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These rivers of suggestion are driving me away.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d really wanted to be on the west coast, striding across the mountains of Fisherfield or Affric, but the weather suggested that south and east would be better with the mountains there escaping the worst of low cloud and drizzle. So it was that I pulled out my Munro map and drew a line between a couple of groups of hills that had unclimbed summits nestled amongst them. I found a start point and an end point served by public transport and that was about it for planning. The rest would be down to weather and willingness. In the end I walked around 75 miles in roughly 73 hours and enjoyed some fine walking and camping along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before lunchtime on Friday I arrived in Killin. It took some persuading the bus driver that I really was getting off here. Perhaps the fact the coach was heading on to Oban via Tyndrum made my destination seem a little tame. Nevertheless, I like Killin, and beyond its quiet streets, pleasant cafes and gently flowing river lies the mighty Lawers range and stretching away north, an area of wild country broken only by long winding glens and lochs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/g9SXDG" title="River Lochay at Killin by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Lochay at Killin" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3742/9945826294_c7102e61cb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an early start from Aberdeen I was able to enjoy a leisurely lunch in the village before seeking out a way onto the mountains. Initially I strolled along the old railway line which leads out to the end of Loch Tay. Sadly this terminates at the gated entrance to Finlarig Lodge and there seemed to be no way through to the main road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/g9TwRT" title="Old Railway in Killin by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old Railway in Killin" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/9945938013_2cf535f9ef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I backtracked, continuing to enjoy the sunshine that filtered down through the trees and eventually worked my way round via the main road which thankfully wasn’t too busy. At a point just beyond where the hydro pipes cross under the road a track leads off north and takes you to the foot of a narrow gauge railway that climbs steeply up the hillside besides the pipes. This makes light work of gaining height and although the sun had been replaced by drizzle sweeping in from Glen Lochay it was pleasant and I enjoyed the views out over Loch Tay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/g9SRuN" title="The Finlarig pipeline by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Finlarig pipeline" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5454/9945805594_13bfccf74b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/g9SE6M" title="Top of the pipeline by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Top of the pipeline" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5327/9945767255_1cc9b791a7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the pipeline a service track is picked up and this is followed around to the Lawers road, just up from the new car park. I had used this track when doing a round of &lt;a href="/blog/2012/09/the-tarmachan-ridge/"&gt;the Tarmachan Ridge&lt;/a&gt; with my aunt and uncle last September. The drizzle eased off and brief rays of sunlight appeared in the distance. Ahead of me Ben Lawers was shrouded in ominous cloud and only snatches of the Tarmachan Ridge could be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc4zEi" title="Loch Tay and Highland Perthshire by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Tay and Highland Perthshire" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/9970531545_bdb9bd06d9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing the road I now followed rare strands of drier ground up to the craggy southwest ridge of Meall Corannaich which tumbles down in a series of steep lumps to the roadside. A path emerged as I reached the crest of the ridge and I followed this as it hugged the hillside, picking a good line up on the west side of the ridge and providing impressive views down to Lochan na Lairige below the misty crags of Meall nan Tarmachan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc54fr" title="Lochan na Lairige by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan na Lairige" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9970624353_173325cd3b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I left the path and climbed back up to the ridge, soon arriving at the cairned top of Sron dha-Murchdi. By now I was in the swirling mist and found the wind blowing fiercely in from the west. It carried me quickly up to the Munro summit of Meall Corranaich where fleeting gaps in the cloud gave me views over to Ben Lawers (&lt;a href="/blog/2011/11/ben-lawers-or-the-clouds-lie-below-coire-nan-cat/"&gt;read about my day trip here&lt;/a&gt;), towering still higher above this lofty 1,000m+ summit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly stopped for some food and a drink but with extremely steep slopes on the east side it was almost impossible to find any decent shelter. The wind chill was very noticeable and I soon got moving again to warm back up. A fine ridge extends north from Meall Corranaich dropping down towards the second, much lower Munro of Meall a' Coire Leith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, as I descended the cloud started to blow through and I enjoyed the views across the green glen to Ben Lawers and An Stuc. With the sunshine a little warmth returned and even the wind dropped slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc3uSV" title="Mist clearing from Lawers by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist clearing from Lawers" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2858/9970320345_c8aa418997_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the low bealach the second Munro was an easy climb following a clear baggers path, eventually bringing me to the summit of this more rounded hill. From the cairn on the plateau there were good views of the Lawers Range and the Invervar hills (&lt;a href="/blog/2009/05/munros-north-of-glen-lyon/"&gt;day hike report&lt;/a&gt;) above Glen Lyon which were catching the late afternoon sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More distant hills were visible but it was clear that dark clouds were rolling in. I considered continuing along the hill to the north before dropping down into Gleann Dà-Eig but, considering the weather and the fact that I’d earlier spied good camping spots further up the glen, I decided to descend directly east from the summit, following a broad ridge that took me down to the swift flowing stream in the glen. I followed this downstream a short distance before I found an ideal grassy area to pitch the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc2Joz" title="Meall nan Tarmachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall nan Tarmachan" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2824/9970170685_058338522d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as the rain came on I got the tent up and was soon inside with a cup of tea, reflecting on a successful first day. It became a blustery evening with constant showers of heavier rain joined together by periods of drizzle. I was quite comfortable under silnylon however and after a few chapters of my book, a Fuizion dinner, hot chocolate and a couple of podcasts drifted off to sleep as the rain pitter-pattered off the outer fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc2CSJ" title="The Allt Gleann Dà-Eig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Allt Gleann Dà-Eig" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7289/9970152134_002c0ed22e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning wasn’t much of an improvement with the surrounding hills shrouded in mist and drizzle still coming down. I got going though as the previous evening whilst perusing the map I’d remembered about the tea room at Innerwick in Glen Lyon. I was walking by 9am, quickly picking up a vehicle track that got me down the glen without much fuss. On the right the famous cloven rock appeared and then I was down through the trees and walking along Glen Lyon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gceBUM" title="Descent to Glen Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent to Glen Lyon" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/9972490233_f669effc68_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said hello to a couple of dog walkers and then enjoyed the wander through the comparatively lush scenery of the glen. The tarmac soon gave out to a more grassy track and I made good time, passing the Scout centre and then crossing the River Lyon at the Bridge of Balgie, arriving at the &lt;a href="http://www.glenlyoncottage.co.uk/index.htm/Food_%26_Drink.html"&gt;tea room&lt;/a&gt; around mid-morning. A pot of tea and a large slice of delicious almond and pistachio cake were consumed in friendly, warm surrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcdRBj" title="Glen Lyon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lyon" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/9972341204_e9e352154a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d noticed a sign for woodland walks and decided to follow one of these, rather than the road, around to the right of way leading to Loch Rannoch, my next destination. This proved to be an interesting diversion with a good path climbing steeply up above the tea room and then bobbing along through moist woods replete with many varieties of toadstool. Birds flitted amongst the trees and there was a steady drip as water trickled off leaves and brances. I followed a few turns and a gentle descent until I came out at the parking area and then it was a short road walk past the war memorial to pick up the &lt;a href="http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/pathdetails.php?path=101"&gt;old kirk road&lt;/a&gt; heading for Loch Rannoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcdEdQ" title="Above Innerwick by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Above Innerwick" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3790/9972302896_012a489f14_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still gloomy but the drizzle had fizzled out as I followed the vehicle track up the glen with pleasant views to the rounded hills ahead. There was a hint of autumn with leaves and bracken yellowing. Beyond a plantation a junction took me northward again and the track climbed steeply above the allt running now far below in a narrow, notched glen between the hills. After the initial climb the going was easy and I ambled along through the Lairig Ghallabhaich to the bealach where it looked like there was more promising weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcdp1L" title="P1080653 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1080653" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5473/9972251736_3e7af61d23_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of stream crossings to negotiate as I followed the track which enjoyed expansive views across the open moorland to the west of the Invervar hills. As I started to drop down towards the Black Wood of Rannoch I met a few folk including a couple who were pondering crossing over to Innerwick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gccHza" title="P1080659 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1080659" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7303/9972119055_3227fbc742_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped down and took a branch off to the right, joining a waymarked walk (part of the &lt;a href="http://www.highlandperthshire.org/wcall/wcrannoch/183-Carie-Rannoch-Forest"&gt;Carie Forest Walks&lt;/a&gt;) that took me down a delightful path high above the tumbling Allt na Bogair on a good path amongst the leaves. The sun was now shining weakly through high cloud and the day was mild. I said hello to a few daytrippers out following the waymarkings and was glad to reach the picnic area at the bottom of the hill where I made use of a bench to have a good sit down lunch as the sun shone down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcczCD" title="P1080661 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1080661" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3684/9972092345_b1509880b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a bit of a road trudge along to Kinloch Rannoch. The road was quiet though and there were plenty of distracting views out across Loch Rannoch itself. I made good time, spurred on by the thought of a pint in the village, but sadly it seemed that the one establishment had closed down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found my way to the bottom of the Allt Mor falls which were spectacular as white water crashed down from high up the hillside. A forest track took me through the woods with the ever present roar of the falls off to the right somewhere. As I climbed the views back across the green strath improved and soon I had a fine view of Schiehallion, now free of cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcbbwk" title="Allt Mor at Kinlochrannoch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt Mor at Kinlochrannoch" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/9971819495_ed40e916fd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the treeline I found a pleasant stop for an afternoon snack, watching as the cloud once again started to thicken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcaBXT" title="Meall Breac by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Breac" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3722/9971709965_894128c28e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track took me up towards the moorland east of the Corbett of Beinn a' Chuallaich, but as it became boggier I lost the way and ended up picking my own route up to the bealach which divides Rannoch from upper Glen Errochty. On the way up I came across ripe, juicy blaeberries amongst the heather and I enjoyed munching on these as I climbed up. Once I reached it the view from the bealach proved to be spectacular with Loch Ericht off to the northwest and hints of the Ben Alder group (&lt;a href="/blog/2012/06/travels-in-the-ben-alder-area-part-2/"&gt;backpacking trip report&lt;/a&gt;) visible beneath the increasing cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying the views I followed a muddy path as it contoured eastward around the hillside above a plantation. Beyond this I dropped down to the glen floor, reaching the river at a point just east of the bothy at Saunich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc9L5A" title="Deer fence on the way to Loch Errochty by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deer fence on the way to Loch Errochty" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/9971542154_08d8509a27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short walk downstream brought me to a fine stretch of grass where the tent was soon pitched.  Nicole had come this way during her &lt;a href="http://ness64.wordpress.com/tgo-challenge-2013/#Day 6"&gt;TGO Challenge this year&lt;/a&gt; and pointed out the good wild camping opportunities. She definitely wasn’t wrong and I was happy to get pitched in the comfort of the glen, sheltered from the increasingly unpleasant elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gc9hLt" title="Camp by the Allt Ruighe nan Saorach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camp by the Allt Ruighe nan Saorach" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3740/9971450275_2c2f2ea7f1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous night I barely had any chance to settle in before the rain started once again and I retired inside for dinner and more of my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning dawned with little improvement. Drizzle and rain had been constantly falling through the night and everything outside was just that bit damper. It was Sunday though so I had a bit of a lie in and didn’t get going until just after 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcN513" title="Loch Errochty by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Errochty" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9978821586_24b04b372d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no clear path to follow I just headed down the glen alongside the allt. Just before I reached Loch Errochty a bridge appeared and a vehicle track began which enabled me to quicken the pace as cold showers continued to blow in from the west.
As I followed the southern shore of the loch promising breaks began to appear in the sky and suddenly there was a rainbow arcing across the ruffled grey water. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around a corner I came across a couple of guys camping. They had driven a truck down the lochside track and had a huge tent and lots of accessories. I had a quick chat but the rain came back on so I drew my hood back up and continued on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stretch along the loch winds through the trees before bringing you out above the dam. I wasn’t sure if it was open but I went down to investigate and found the gate unlocked. I strolled across the dam to reach a service road on the far side.
This led me to the trip’s final significant stretch of public road walking, taking me roughly north along the route of a Wade Military Road to the A9 and the southern approaches to the Gaick hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcN6Bg" title="Rainbow over Glen Garry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over Glen Garry" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5525/9978826993_b574c60933_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather continued to be mixed as I ascended to the high point but more rainbows came out to liven the view and again it was a very quiet road. There are new pylons along here so the whole place is a bit of a construction site but as I started to drop down towards the River Garry the scenery opened up and sunlight illuminated the southern aspects of the Gaick hills. I entered the Cairngorms National Park and made light work of the A9 crossing to reach Dalnacardoch woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short stroll through the woods brought me out to a point where I had a good long view up the length fo the Edendon Water and here I paused for lunch. There was a mobile phone mast right by the track so I had the opportunity to send a few messages, post a photo and check Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In increasing sunshine and warmth I strolled up this long glen wih the wild looking hills getting ever closer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the river beyond an abandoned building I left the main track and followed a muddy Argocat track up the side of the hill, aiming roughly to ascend to the top of Glas Mheall Mòr via the lower hills above Sronphadruig Lodge. The way was boggy and a little tiresome but the views and weather improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcLfRJ" title="The Edendoh Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Edendoh Water" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3785/9978467884_0217e8c468_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ascended though I found an incredibly strong wind blowing that slowed down progress despite reaching firmer ground. I battled against the wind, eventually making it to the top of Glas Mheall Mòr which was bathed in beautiful afternoon sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcL7Cb" title="Perthshire Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Perthshire Hills" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/9978440186_3e5951099f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here the views were glorious encompassing the wide sweep of Highland Perthshire to the south, and the mooorland to the north with the three Gaick Munros rising out of the heathery swell. Away to the northeast I got my first glimpse of the high Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcKnTb" title="Summit of Glas Mheall Mòr by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Glas Mheall Mòr" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/9978296404_7737092ce9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a steep descent down to the next stream crossing before I started the long rise back yp to the Munro summit of A’ Bhuidheanach Bheag. On the way there were fine views west to Loch Garry which was catching the afternoon sunlight as clouds continued to swirl around Loch Ericht and the Drumochter Hills (&lt;a href="/blog/2010/02/the-west-drumochter-munros/"&gt;day hike report&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcKd55" title="Loch Garry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Garry" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/9978263396_e5e4157a7a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the Munro summit to find it deserted, a chill wind blowing, though certainly less ferocious than it had been an hour before. Sunlight was catching various hills to the east whilst off to the west stunning crepuscular rays cascaded down through dark clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a high route taking me around the eastern end of Cama' Choire and across various minor tops to reach the second Munro of Carn na Caim perched high above Newtonmore and Speyside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was closing in as I reached the summit and the last of the views faded just as I reached the summit cairn. It had been a long day and the third Munro still looked a long way off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcHLbJ" title="Summit of Carn na Caim by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn na Caim" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/9977981206_f2c4b7bc5d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than trooping off towards it I decided to make the most of the calmer conditions and get the tent pitched. With the wind blowing in from the west I descended the gentle eastern slopes of Carn na Caim and found what seemed a sheltered spot on a high perch above Coire Cam with views out to Newtonmore in the distance. It was pretty calm and I got the tent up and a brew on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, as I was drinking my tea a sudden change in the weather happened - a band of clouds rolled in accompanied by ferocious gusts of wind. The tent shook and buckled and my lofty perch suddenly felt very exposed. Rather than face the possibility of a broken tent I packed everything up, donned my headtorch and in the fading light headed downhill to the east, just beyond the next rise in the plateau. I soon found what I was seeking, an infant stream winding its way down towards a drop off into Coire Chais below. Here between releatively high banks was lush green ground and I got the tent pitched again. I could hear the wind tearing across the tops just above me but I was much more sheltered and, finally settled, I could get dinner on and relax after another long old day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dark the wind seemed to drop almost completely and I emerged from the tent to find a beautiful starry sky, the odd cloud clinging to the Cairngoms off to the east. Ursa Major gaurded the north whilst in the south a waning moon shone out illuminating the landscape. The Summer Triangle stood respendent high over head. I must have spent half an hour just quietly watching the slow drift of the stars, my eyes adjusting to the moonlight and the quiet calm of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcHmYi" title="Ursa Major by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ursa Major" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/9977903113_aaabec20cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got some sleep but couldn’t resist another peek at the stars at around 4:30am. The seasons had shifted and now Orion marched across the southern sky, my first view of this harbinger of winter. The clouds had largely disappeared and there was a flat calm across these wild, empty hills. There was not a single hint of any other human presence in my wide field of view and I felt priviledged to be here in this quiet corner of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gcGM7U" title="The quiet march of the stars by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The quiet march of the stars" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/9977789236_8148d9ba84_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set my alarm for predawn and snuggled back into my warm down sleeping bag. When I was woken by my phone an hour or so later there was a dusky glow to the eastern sky and as I watched from the warm comfort of the tent the silhouetted shapes of the Cairngorms emerged, only to be lost as a haziness filled every hollow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdmGHh" title="Cairngorms at Dawn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms at Dawn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2836/9985188666_b5659c11ec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a chilly start to the day but a cup of coffee warmed me up as I watched the cloud thicken and thin, the light shifting as sunrise approached. Finally the sun crested the hill and began to warm up the day. Everything was utterly drenched in dew after the calm conditions over night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the temperature rose I got everything packed up and headed off into the misty morning. Cloud was rising and falling as the air temperature changed but up on the plateau it was more often misty than not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a high start there wasn’t much height to gain and I could just follow the undulating lip of Coire Chais as it headed first east and then north. There was no really convenient direct route to the next Munro but I had decided it was better to stay high rather than drop down towards Loch Cuaich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was beautiful with the sun shining weakly through the haze and occassional snatches of most distant views. It was warming rapidly and the ferocious wind of the previous evening was a distant memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdkGiE" title="Early morning sunshine by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Early morning sunshine" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/9984992184_d4a18b7a10_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed over a few lumpy tops separated by delightful stretches of swampy bog that required some careful footwalk before reaching the short-clipped heather and moss that marked the summit of A'Mharconaich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdjZf8" title="Meall Cuaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Cuaich" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5480/9984854055_127057a69d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views still weren’t great but the cloud definitely seemed to be thinning and I was hopefuly of getting a view from the trip’s final Munro. There is now an interesting stretch which belies this area’s dull reputation. A narrow path descends to the col below A'Mharconaich and follows a high route perched above the crags of Coire Chuaich, the coire floor a long way below The ground is treacheroulsy steep but the path is surefooted and soon starts to descend through heather, making a couple of zig-zags before dropping you down gently at the bealach below Bogha-cloiche and Meall Cuaich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down in the sunshine it was warm and I followed a narrow track up the steep southeastern flank of the Munro. As I climbed the views up the wild headwaters of the Allt na Fearna opened up with the Cairngorms once again clearing of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdjoc2" title="Below Meall Cuaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Below Meall Cuaich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/9984736135_676596c5d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly my ascent brought me back into the cloud and after reaching the broad ridge and making it to the top there was no rewarding view from the large summit cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdjCAF" title="Summit of Meall Cuaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Meall Cuaich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9984784603_9ace0eacfb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung around for half an hour so, hoping that the thin cloud might clear but it never did and after a snack I decided to get moving again. Now I was heading north, dropping down a shallow slope first before a steep bouldery ascent got me down onto a snaking vehicle track winding its way along the Glen Tromie. On the steep descent I managed to put my foot on a boulder covered in moss and lichen and my foot slipped. I caught myself with my pole but in the process it bent and then snapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdj6hG" title="Hills between Speyside and Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hills between Speyside and Tromie" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2852/9984679276_448b088242_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The going was mostly easy although short stretches where numerous vehicles had churned up the track into more of a quagmire were difficult to cross without wallowing too much in mud. The views into Glen Tromie and eastward towards the Gaick developed and underneath the cloud (which was rapidly clearing from all but the highest slopes) it was warm and sunny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdigSF" title="Meall Cuaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meall Cuaich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7460/9984519775_a0c5929c8e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track became better surfaced as I got closer to Glen Tromie and soon Meall Cuaich was a distant hill some way behind me and I was approaching the lush greenery around the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdi7dZ" title="Track to Glen Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track to Glen Tromie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7409/9984487313_a26d73fe94_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way along the western bank, stopping briefly for a drink and to wash my face, before I found the footbridge hidden in a thickly wooded cutting. Once on the other side I was on tarmac for the walk through Glen Tromie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set a steady pace and as noon approached stopped beside the river for lunch. A huge construction lorry passed by but mostly it was very quiet in the glen. That was until the RAF jet showed up, flying low above the glen and making its way quickly and noisily south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdggrW" title="River Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Tromie" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5504/9984128116_d156545fb0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was perfect ambling weather and I enjoyed the sights and sounds of this glen. Eventually I reached the turning for Glen Tromie Lodge which led me across the river and then on a waymarked track up through yellowing bracken towards the hillside that would take me across to Speyside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdfHis" title="River Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Tromie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/9984019976_166c616327_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cairned summit was reached as the views opened out across to Sgor Gaoith and the western Cairngorms and then finally ahead of me were the Monadliath mountains with Kingussie nestled below the rolling summits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdfcUV" title="Glen Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Tromie" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3748/9983921113_a93886d4ed_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the track as it wound its way down towards Ruthven Barracks. There was a herd of cows to bypass but otherwise I was soon amongst the day trippers and tourists on the outskirts of Kingussie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdekai" title="Speyside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Speyside" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/9983750383_b89abb8af2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trips final road march took my under the A9 and across the Spey and then into Kingussie where the station was an easy walk away. I enquired about the quickest way to Aberdeen and was told I had five minutes until the Inverness-bound train arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gddtZh" title="Ruthven Barracks by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruthven Barracks" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5458/9983584966_ccaa2a7572_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was tempted to hang around and get some food in Kingussie (especially as it turned out that there would be only a five minute change at Inverness) but the thought of getting back to Aberdeen early evening was too tempting and so I purchased my ticket and went out onto the platform to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gdcZgx" title="Inverness train arrives at Kingussie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Inverness train arrives at Kingussie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7318/9983488353_1765384ca0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey home was largely uneventful. The train ride to Inverness was in beautiful sunshine on a quiet train. The Aberdeen service left on time, was a little busier, and incredibly warm, but I was able to sample the delights of the buffet trolley and so the time passed well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="wild camping"></category><category term="gaick"></category><category term="lawers"></category><category term="glen lyon"></category><category term="loch errochty"></category><category term="loch rannoch"></category><category term="kingussie"></category><category term="killin"></category></entry><entry><title>Cairngorms Traverse 2013</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/09/cairngorms-traverse-13/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-09-08T20:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-09-08T20:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-09-08:/blog/2013/09/cairngorms-traverse-13/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A high level north-south traverse through the Cairngorms taking in the Fiacaill Ridge, Loch Avon and Derry Cairngorm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 8th September 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 23.02km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,539m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Derry Cairngorm [Munro]    &lt;br&gt;
Weather: A blustery cold wind but improving conditions with sunshine       &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/212"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was bright and breezy at the Coire Cas car park below Cairn Gorm where our booting up antics provided plenty of entertainment for the tourists waiting to catch the funicular railway. The fine track leading southwestward was followed towards Coire an t-Sneachda providing excellent views across the Rothiemurchas forest, Loch Morlich and a more distant Aviemore. The sky to the north was blue with hazy cloud off in the distance whilst to our south grey clouds sat low over the Northern Corries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a branch in the track a few folk continued on to take the more gentle approach to the lip of the northern corries via the Cairn Lochan ridge, whilst the rest of us climbed up towards the lower slopes of the Fiacaill Ridge. The track petered out as we climbed up amongst the boulders but the wide crest of the ridge offered gentle scrambling amongst blocky granite. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views across to the less developed ridges of Cairn Gorm were good and we started to get a good look deep into Coire an t-Sneachda. The ridge levelled out and a further series of scrambles brought us along to the interesting part of the Faicaill Ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvp1bM" title="The Fiacaill Ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Fiacaill Ridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8538/10178018105_8c113c17b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left hand side was damp with a slight bulge that was enough to put me off. Rather we went around the right hand side, bypassing the crest itself but still finding some entertaining rock work just below it. A steep scrabble bypassed the initial steep front of the ridge and then it was possible to rejoin the ridgeline for the final pull up to the top. It was an exhilarating few minutes and we soon found ourselves slightly breathless, perched on the edge of the Northern Corries looking out at a sunny world as the last of the cloud blew through on a chill wind. To the south and west the plateau spread out, pock marked by corries and glens with the distant peaks dark folds on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the rest of the group headed for Ben Macdui, I chose a different course (after all, I had done much of the plateau route on the &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/06/tgoc-part-3/"&gt;TGO Challenge back in May&lt;/a&gt; after reaching the top via Lurcher’s Crag) and headed east. A good track traces its way along the lip of the Northern Corries. Before long I was on Stob Coire an t-Sneachda enjoying the expansive views back to the Fiacaill Ridge and onward to Cairn Gorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvowD3" title="The Fiacaill Ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Fiacaill Ridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8555/10177925436_d81b8759b8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track dropped down towards the large cairn at Point 1141 but as the Coire Raibert track appeared across the upper drainage I crossed to it and turned south. The track has recently been repaired and upgraded and is a very good surface as it drops towards the tors of Beinn Mheadhoin across the deep trench holding Loch Avon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvnziy" title="The track through Coire Raibert by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track through Coire Raibert" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5493/10177739286_1eb07820c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvmvrf" title="Coire Raibert by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Raibert" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3727/10177531164_eab4fd3f42_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon the track and its adjacent stream started to fall more rapidly towards Loch Avon whose shimmering blue-green waters appeared far below me. The good quality track continued for some way with stone steps in parts allowing me to lose height quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvm2n9" title="First glimpse of Loch Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="First glimpse of Loch Avon" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3682/10177436734_6ecd965391_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvk4ny" title="Loch Avon from Coire Raibert by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Avon from Coire Raibert" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3710/10177248374_d50a1515d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the good surface ended and it was a steep and scrabbly descent that sometimes seemed to go directly along the water course. After a couple of slippery sections a rough track was picked up that passed through thick heather on the final descent to the shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvjDWY" title="Loch Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Avon" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5518/10177169576_0c000081c4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path by the loch was excellent and I enjoyed my walk westward, watching as the massive Shelter Stone Crag got closer and closer. This is a big landscape, the clear depths of the water overlooked by dramatic crags and a feeling of being locked away from the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvjGPt" title="Loch Avon and Shelter Stone crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Avon and Shelter Stone crag" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2881/10177179233_4b7d3f8012_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the loch with its sandy beached appeared around the final rise in the land and I found myself staring up at the grand cirque of crags that formed the head of Glen Avon. The Garbh Uisge Beag and the Feith Buidhe were fine white strands cascading down the rocks whilst the Shelter Stone Crag now loomed near at hand. It is a magnificent, humbling spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvhYVc" title="Head of Loch Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of Loch Avon" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/10176843165_fe2792ca83_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I padded across the first beach and crossed the first of two inflows to the loch easily by way of a line of a stepping stones. On the gravelly beach here between the flowing streams I paused to eat my lunch. A cool breeze was blowing up from Glen Avon but otherwise it was as peaceful and lonely a spot as you could want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvgkVb" title="The Feith Buidhe and head of Glen Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Feith Buidhe and head of Glen Avon" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7379/10176523584_7ba603f945_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I briefly deviated from my route to visit the famous Shelter Stone. A huge boulder that has crashed down from the crags above, it has enough space under it for a rudimentary but dry shelter and has been used both deliberately and in an emergency by countless visitors to this wild location. I had a brief explore and took in the views from this inconic spot before returning to the path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gvgMfS" title="Exploring the area below Shelter Stone Crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Exploring the area below Shelter Stone Crag" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3698/10176608826_a179daa686_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good path climbs up from the head of Loch Avon towards Coire Etchachan. I ascended quickly, rapidly gaining on a couple of guys some way ahead. The track offered magnificent views back across Loch Avon and around the headwall of the glen. In the distance the Saddle sat between Cairngorm and Bynack More. After a sightly dull period the sun had returned and the afternoon light was particularly striking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I climbed the whump-whump-whump sound of a helicopter began and soon a yellow Sea King could be seen flying low down Loch Avon. It did a couple of turns about the loch, dropped a flare near the Shelter Stone, hovered over that for a while and then disappeared back the way it had come. On one circulation it passed close to me and I got a friendly wave from the winchman who was standing at the open door. I figured after all this that it was a training exercise rather than a search and rescue operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the final views into Glen Avon before the gradient finally eased and I found myself in a bouldery landscape just below Loch Etchachan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boulders and pools were negotiated and then I followed the good track around the edge of Loch Etchachan. There was more whump-whumping and I paused to watch the Sea King fly over in the direction of Ben Macdui. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the loch it was easy enough to follow the track up towards Coire Sputan Dearg, cutting off part way up to cross the low bealach below Creagan a' Choire Etchachan and make my way towards Derry Cairngorm. Without deep snow (&lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/07/derry-cairngorm/"&gt;present the last time I had been this way&lt;/a&gt;) it was an easy walk up through the boulders to the summit of the Munro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way up the views across to Coire Sputan Dearg, the green lochan and the westerly hills of the Cairngorms opened up nicely and I paused often to watch the changing light as it caught different hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views back towards Beinn Mheadhoin and Glen Avon were spectacular as clouds drifted high above the landscape. I picked my way through the final boulders to reach the second cairn which enjoyed far reaching views south across Deeside and into Perthshire. The Cairn Toul massif was now clearly seen to the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying a final snack on the blustery summit I continued my course southward, following the undulating series of bumps that lie between Derry Cairngorm and Carn Crom perched high above Glens Derry and Luibeg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/gv6EdV" title="The Luibeg Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Luibeg Burn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3695/10174634045_1397da0d4e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a case of following the excellently constructed path which winds down between the crags and through the pines to Derry Lodge itself. Here I paused to wait for a group of others who had descended from Carn a' Mhaim and were crossing the flats. It was at this time that the stiff breeze died completely and the midgies came out in force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a bit of company the Derry Road passed quickly enough and as we crossed the Lui Water and picked our way back to the coach waiting at the Linn of Dee the clouds finally moved in and the sunshine faded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 17th August 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 29.35km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 638m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None  &lt;br&gt;
Weather: High winds, cloud and sunny showers     &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the August Stocket walk was wonderful. On one of the single best days of the summer we enjoyed beautiful sunshine and a cooling breeze as we traversed from the Linn of Dee through to Coylumbridge via the Cairn Toul massif on the west side of Glen Dee. Any repeat of such a glorious day was not to be this year though as forecast high winds, low cloud and bands of rain made us rethink our plan of a full traverse of the wide open spaces of the Ben Avon plateau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fwu4su" title="Rainbow below Carn Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow below Carn Liath" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/9533964396_43a5c82e9c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fweL3M" title="IMG_4269 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4269" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3724/9531174265_9a8869c9c7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we followed good tracks north from Invercauld, climbing steadily up to the col between Carn Liath and Culardoch where mist enveloped us and the winds made us unsteady on our feet. We dropped down into Glen Gairn and made our way around to Loch Builg for a spot of lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fwtW8u" title="Loch Builg by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Builg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/9533939746_6a8963d2c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was down Glen Builg as the skies gradually brightened and by the time we reached Inchrory and the waters of the River Avon it was hot and we were rapidly shedding layers. We walked out along the track that parallels the infant waters of the River Don, gradually dropping towards Corgarff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fwtJwj" title="Glen Builg by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Builg" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2865/9533900702_ffc0197c12_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a final brief shower the sun came out for good, the clouds scudding low over the green hills, glistening with that freshly washed look after the rain. We came across the Royal shooting party, a vast array of Land Rovers and Range Rovers trundling up the track, some with armed soldiers in them. Above us, marksmen stood behind the ranked grouse butts as beaters scurried about the heather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fwdG4B" title="Strath Don by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Strath Don" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5340/9530965745_8a789639d3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last we were past all the commotion and at the coach and soon supping pints in the Allargue Arms before a swift journey back to Aberdeen in the evening sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category></entry><entry><title>Glen Dee Overnighter</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/08/glen-dee-overnighter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-08-03T22:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-08-03T22:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-08-03:/blog/2013/08/glen-dee-overnighter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A planned big route in the Cairngorms cut short by high winds above 900m.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2nd-3rd August 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 32.71km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,160m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Sgor Mor [Corbett]  &lt;br&gt;
Weather: High winds, cloud and sunny showers     &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/14222/nickbramhll/The-DeeFeshieGeldie-Loop"&gt;Click to view on Social Hiking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Traffic.&lt;/em&gt; It's Friday afternoon, just before five, and I'm in a line of cars and trucks and motorcycles, engines thrumming amidst a pall of fumes and dust as we crawl ever closer to the roundabout at the Bridge of Dee. I look around and wonder: how many of these people are here every week, every day, sitting in the same line? Are they going home, to the gym, to visit friends and family? How many are escaping the city and its nightmare of gridlock?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnyova" title="Linn of Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Linn of Dee" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5541/9432960451_d09eb7ff5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light.&lt;/em&gt; Two hours later I'm looking at beautiful evening sunshine spilling through the archway of the stone bridge crossing the deep gorge at the Linn of Dee. The river whirls and eddies in slow motion between the towering walls of rock. Crowned with harebells the Linn holds my attention for only a short time before the track through the woods beckons me towards the open country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnybgH" title="Glen Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Dee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/9432919303_01c5332c1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hillside.&lt;/em&gt; Above the river the heather clad hillside stretches above me. The going is hard but my feet pick out a wandering way up between moss-covered boulders and along narrow deer runs. A new electric fence diverts me briefly into the pines that cling to the southern slopes but above them is nothing but heather and the evening sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnNngQ" title="Evening light by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Evening light" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7366/9435687882_7b9b811496_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Plateau.&lt;/em&gt; From the cairn on the summit of Carn an 'lc Duibhe a swell of short-cropped heather rises up to the jumbled summit of Sgor Dubh. The electric fence parallels me on my left but I defocus it out of sight as the sunlight catches the high rounded hills to the south of the Geldie. To the right beyond Luibeag are the central Cairngorms green and grey, sombre beneath a dark veil of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnN7t9" title="Sunburst by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunburst" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/9435638078_66268827ff_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Burst.&lt;/em&gt; The rain starts as I pitch the tent. I'm in a hollow on the ridge just before the final rise to the summit of Sgor Mor. It offers a small degree of protection from the gusting wind which made even standing still difficult on Sgor Dubh. As I'm getting soaked by the rain, the tent bucking as I thread the pole, a sudden burst of sunlight spills out from behind the low cloud in the northwest. The notched gap of Glen Geusachan behind the Devil's Point is filled with light. It silhouettes the hills and brings some final warmth to the day. The show is brief but spectacular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fngoMK" title="Cairngorms Wild Camp by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms Wild Camp" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3804/9429644509_8ae58ca1d3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the light fades the wind and rain renew their attack and so I retire to the tent for tea, a hot chocolate and a podcast or two as the tent shakes in the gusting wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnxvzV" title="Punch bowls on Sgor Mor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Punch bowls on Sgor Mor" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7436/9432789163_759458aef1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Summit.&lt;/em&gt; The next morning the cloud has dropped another few hundred feet or so, the mountains cut off at chest rather than neck height. Occasional bursts of rain patter on the tent as I have a coffee and breakfast. The summit of Sgor Mor is just a short distance away and I reach it before 9, a little disappointed that the views up the Lairig Ghru are largely obscured by cloud. The wind is incredibly strong up here on this exposed summit and flecks of rain from showers passing along Glen Geldie splash across my camera lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnMfkS" title="River Dee at Whitebridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Dee at Whitebridge" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/9435469456_9077691649_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;River.&lt;/em&gt; It's an easy descent down heathery slopes to the River Dee where I join a narrow footpath. This leads me down to Whitebridge passing the falls and pools at the Chest of Dee. It's appreciably calmer down in the glen but the dark clouds scudding above are signs that there is no relenting higher up on more exposed ground. By the river below the bridge I have a snack and watch the Dee roll by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnMaCU" title="Cairn Geldie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Geldie" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5541/9435453624_caf6a6e0b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Attack.&lt;/em&gt; From Whitebridge I clamber up more heathery slopes to the modest summit of Cairn Geldie which sits between the Dee and the Geldie and leads to a stretch of bog and pools that guard this southern approach to Beinn Bhrotain, the most southerly of the Munros on this western side of Glen Dee. It's not until I reach the eastern shoulder of Carn Cloich-mhuilinn that I join a narrow track winding its way up the hill. On this exposed slope the wind once again strengthens and by the time I'm on the final pull up to the summit it is hindering my progress. I struggle up, being knocked off my feet a couple of times as I negotiate otherwise easy ground. It's a little scary and I'm glad to reach the summit where the tiny cairn offers the smallest of respites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnwtKe" title="Allt Garbh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt Garbh" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3719/9432587863_dd3fe6e924_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retreat.&lt;/em&gt; Sat on the summit of Carn Cloich-mhuilinn with the wind raging around me I weigh up my options. The route I had in mind involves several more miles of rough ground above 900m walking directly into the fierce wind. There are boulder fields to negotiate as well as further exposed slopes and I'm not confident of avoiding an ankle-snapping stumble given the wind conditions. It doesn't feel like a good idea and from the col before Beinn Bhrotain I decide to leave the high route for another day. The Allt Garbh offers an easy way off the hillside and I take it, following the stream down and eventually picking up a good path that drops me back down to Glen Dee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnsyFs" title="Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/9431824016_05abb1ce6e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solace.&lt;/em&gt; As always happens the conditions once down in the shelter of the glen are benign. The sun comes out from behind the clouds and it is warm, summery, idyllic. I look back up at the dark slopes of Beinn Bhrotain, doubting my own decision. A cuppa made from the tumbling allt clears my head and I look to the fabulous views of upper Glen Dee and the Lairig Ghru as the sunlight plays across the hillsides. It rains again just as I'm packing away the stove and the flickering shadows prove that the wind is still untenable up high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fnvEVa" title="Dark clouds above the Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dark clouds above the Dee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/9432430331_d8205d85d7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk back to the Linn of Dee provides an ever changing landscape of sky and hills as the light changes and showers pass through. The waterproofs stay on as a few errant splashes of rain catch up with me but more times than not it is sunny and warm. The Dee is my handrail as I leave behind the Devil's Point and Beinn Bhrotain and the gentler hills close to the Linn unfold before me. It always feels like a long road, the road from Whitebridge, but the miles pass and the car is there, and then there is just the drive back to the Aberdeen. I'm back a full day earlier than planned but it was still a wonderful trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I deliberately kept photos and words to a minimum with this report. If you would like to see more of the trip then please take a look at the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/sets/72157634910842325/"&gt;full set over on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain seemed to start seconds after we pulled up in the tiny hamlet of Calvine, just off the A9 near Blair Atholl. It was two in the morning on a humid midsummer night and we were here to walk north across the hills to Glen Feshie, some twenty-four miles away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain seemed to start seconds after we pulled up in the tiny hamlet of Calvine, just off the A9 near Blair Atholl. It was two in the morning on a humid midsummer night and we were here to walk north across the hills to Glen Feshie, some twenty-four miles away. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Under heavy clouds it was the dark middle of the night and we only slowly got ourselves ready. Towards 2:30am the rain eased and with headlamps on we moved off, winding our way through a back lane and then carefully crossing the A9 to reach the land rover track on the far side. This would lead us across the low hills to the north of the main road and then down into Glen Bruar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twinkling tail of head lights was an interesting sight as we slowly gained height. Very gradually the pale light of dawn crept up over us and after disturbing a huge herd of deer we dropped down to the Water of Bruar. There are a number of dams on this river and after a few weeks of little rainfall there was almost nothing more than a rocky river bed to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUSy2J" title="Cloudy dawn in Glen Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloudy dawn in Glen Bruar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3827/9130959124_3566752ee2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUSwFQ" title="Track through Glen Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Bruar" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7449/9130954606_d3fbf61fc9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound our way along the track, passing a somewhat bedraggled group of tents, and then crossing the river at Bruar Lodge where in the cold, pale light of morning we stopped for our first breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUSunQ" title="Glen Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Bruar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/9130946834_4a56fee663_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of brave and hardy souls left us at this point, heading up into the low cloud to climb the Munro Beinn Dearg which sits to the east above the glen. We meanwhile continued to follow Glen Bruar as it narrowed and climbed steadily upwards. At the point where two streams merge to create the Bruar Water we met the bottom of the cloud base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUEYN8" title="Glen Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Bruar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3831/9128701091_6346bd6321_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a stiff ascent on a clear track and then we were following the white cairns that mark &lt;a href="http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/pathdetails.php?path=212"&gt;the Minigaig&lt;/a&gt;.  This high pass was an old route through the mountains that fell into disuse when the military road was constructed across the pass at Drumochter to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUEV3v" title="The Minigaig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Minigaig" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/9128688469_17d80ace3a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now we were in thick mist that hid the surrounding landscape from view. It was damp but reasonably mild. After crossing Uchd a' Chlàrsair and dropping to a tributory stream we briefly lost the main track but picked our way along the main course of the Caochan Lub up to the watershed. Here in the mist we had our second breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUEQvx" title="Caochan Lub by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Caochan Lub" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5519/9128673217_9330d570ee_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The white cairns were found again here and we followed the Minigaig up to the high point of the pass at 833m. Out of the gloom loomed the dark slopes of the Corbett Leathad an Taobhain. We followed the broad ridge up to the 902m summit and then made our way to the true summit at 912m, only a couple of metres short of Munro height. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a gloomy place in the mist but there was a general feeling of satisfaction at having reached this remote and unassuming summit. It was disappointing though not to get any sense of its place in these wide, rolling hills west of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUS67U" title="Summit of Leathad an Taobhain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Leathad an Taobhain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7402/9130868596_bc00350d5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the trig point on the summit we dropped quickly down the northern slope. As we did so the clouds seemed to thin and suddenly there were hazy views, down towards the headwaters of the Feshie and west towards Glen Tromie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUEGuz" title="Headwaters of the Tromie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Headwaters of the Tromie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7380/9128646249_e1021de0f9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dropped to a bealach and then ascended past the ruins of a howff up to join a vehicle track near the summit of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eURSF9" title="Showers over the upper Feshie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers over the upper Feshie" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3803/9130826734_2b78f88129_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short stretch of cross country got us across to Glas-leathad Lorgaidh which was to be our last summit of the day. We stopped here for third breakfast, enjoying the sight of showers drifting down the Feshie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eURDX3" title="Cloud over the Feshie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over the Feshie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/9130783924_d826530fa7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a rough descent off angling down towards the Allt Lorgaidh which had something of a stalker’s path running alongside it. This was followed as much as possible (the odd stretch was being rapidly lost to river erosion) until the notch of Slochd Beag appeared ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eURB21" title="Slochd Beag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slochd Beag" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5520/9130774062_40cc448cd3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The steep path dropped us quickly down as ahead the views into Glen Feshie opened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eURoS3" title="Glen Feshie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Feshie" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3796/9130733174_95eaf4257a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After negotiating the zig-zags which wound down through rocky slopes there was an easy stretch of path following the stream as it headed down to meet the Feshie. We stopped part way down to allow everyone to catch up, marvelling as the sun broke through from behind a cloud with blue skies apeparing over the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUR21E" title="Slochd Beag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slochd Beag" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/9130659666_841633a88a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we joined the vehicle track in Glen Feshie, making our way through the glen and enjoying the warm sunshine. The river sparkled, the trees were green, the mountains dark above. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we progressed the cloud built back up again and as we neared the bridge south of Achleum the rain came on again, heavier than it had been since the very early hours of the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eUCVQr" title="River Feshie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Feshie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7384/9128300909_967def12da_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully it was only a couple more kms on a good track to Auchlean and then along to the parking area where the coach was waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rain continued for twenty minutes or so but we got the barbeques going and just as they were coming up to temperature the sun reappeared. Thereafter it was a celebration of burgers, beer and strawberrie for a successful crossing of the hills and the arrival of another midsummer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="corbett"></category><category term="minigaig"></category><category term="glen feshie"></category><category term="glen bruar"></category></entry><entry><title>Loch Kinord</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/03/loch-kinord/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-03-17T20:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-03-17T20:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-03-17:/blog/2013/03/loch-kinord/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A short Sunday morning stroll around Loch Kinord on Deeside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out beyond Aboyne the road is rapidly turning white, a layer of slush forming as fat flakes of snow fall from a uniform grey sky. An estate landrover in polished racing green storms past me. At Dinnet the car park is empty, the potholes filled with a soupy slush. I’m soon heading off, the shelter of the forest a welcome respite from the snow. The world is white. At the first lochan, the surface is completely frozen and the trees have a strange and ethereal look as they flicker behind the mist. The track is waymarked and easy. Snow over slush over mud. Loch Kinord comes into sight and I sweep right, following narrow tracks that hug the shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3Ua61" title="Seating by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Seating" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8369/8565447366_4dd0b6b917_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m warm but a mixture of ice and snow is rapidly covering my outer wear and my pack. The track weaves in and out of trees and reeds, sometimes getting lost in a swampy morass. Eventually it swings away from an increasingly tangled shoreline to rejoin the main path that takes me along past the crannog isle and then up to the Celtic stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3UN4q" title="Details by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Details" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8506/8565571742_0c5505eea3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this western end of the loch the path runs on a course through the foothills, twisting and turning through groves of Beech. The loch is some way away, occasionally glimpsed through a break in the trees. I pass the Burn o’ Vat car park and decide to head up to the Vat itself. Untrodden paths take me quickly there, my feet squeaking softly in the freshly falling snow. The Vat is empty of people but not of water. I clamber across the stones to reach the falls, the water sluicing down mossy rocks in a noisy torrent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/e3NSDi" title="Icy pine by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Icy pine" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8089/8564416491_51b0c81776_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I follow the upper path back to the visitor centre and rejoin the Loch Kinord circular trail. There is another stretch away from the lochside and now I am following in the tracks of a pair of cyclists. It’s not quite a Winnie the Pooh adventure. Along the southern shore the path heads back to the lochside. I stop for a final time to gaze out across the glassy waters. Things are a bit clearer now and a few waterfowl disturb the waters further out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the circuit complete I follow the easy track quickly back to Dinnet. Everywhere in the village is shut but a short drive takes me to Ballater where The Bothy welcomes me with a roaring stove, a fabulous bacon roll, and several large mugs of coffee. I settle down with a good book and while away the rest of my Sunday morning, watching as rain streams down beyond the misted window.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="loch"></category><category term="winter"></category><category term="snow"></category><category term="deeside"></category><category term="dinnet"></category><category term="ballater"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fairy Glen and Upper Gairn</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/02/glen-gairn/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-02-17T20:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-02-17T20:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-02-17:/blog/2013/02/glen-gairn/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A low route in the Eastern Cairngorms with a winter wild camp in Gleann an t-Slugain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 16-17th February 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 27.48km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 805m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5 hrs 40 mins  &lt;br&gt;
Hills:  None &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Mild air temperatures but snow underfoot, chill wind, low clouds.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no qualms about labelling myself as a fair-weather hiker, and perhaps even more so, a fair-weather backpacker. The thought of a spending a restless night in a tent being thrown about by gusting winds or lashed by rain really doesn’t appeal. And so it was that several weekends in January and February were dismissed for one weather-related reason or another. Eventually though there was a hint of something better in the forecast, with milder temperatures and gentler winds promised I packed up my camping gear and headed for the Cairngorms. With just an afternoon and a morning available I chose a straightforward circular route from Keiloch on the A93 a few miles east of Braemar. An overnight camp would break up the 18 miles quite nicely and would give me an opportunity to try some mild winter camping. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive was was sunny with scraps of grey snow piled up next to the road the only sign of the past few weeks of heavy snowfall, low temperatures and gale-force winds. From Keiloch I followed the estate tracks through Invercauld enjoying the pleasant air. So much so that I missed a turning and ended up on the wrong side of the glen. After a steep descent and a brief toe-wetting crossing of the Slugain Water I was back on course and heading up the glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dWhR7C" title="Lochan on Invercauld Estate by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan on Invercauld Estate" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8246/8490659012_9f1f85f07f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dWhP4N" title="Glen an t-Slugain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen an t-Slugain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8225/8490652120_880a72268d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapidly I left behind the mild woods and out in the exposed country there was a chilly wind and deep snow. Nevertheless I made good progress and by 4pm had reached my intended camp spot, a flat, sheltered spot in the narrow upper-reaches of the glen where the vehicle track becomes a path and everything feels that bit wilder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dWhNpS" title="Heading up the Slugain Glen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading up the Slugain Glen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8490649920_22484a4f1e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had fun pitching the tent. I stamped out a platform in the snow and then set about trying to get my pegs to hold in the slushy snow. It was easy to dig all the way down to terra firma but the earth was iron-hard and unyielding to titanium. Therefore I ended up forming some makeshift dead men which, with a little work-hardening of the snow, were secure enough to get a decently tight pitch. I soon settled in with a coffee and a book to watch as the light slowly faded. As sunset approached a blush of colour tinged the sky but soon enough the low cloud was back and it looked unlikely I would get any opportunities for stargazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a cozy night I was up before dawn and following a warming breakfast of coffee and porridge headed off up the glen just as a grey, monochrome daylight broke over the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXbFLp" title="Path through Glenn an t-Slugain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Path through Glenn an t-Slugain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8380/8500773387_702c604e85_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path was covered in consolidated snow but it yielded easily to my boots and I made quick progress up to the Slugain Ruin where another couple of campers were just waking up (I had seen their headlamps bobbing up the glen the previous evening after nightfall). I continued on past the frozen lochan and up to the watershed where there were expansive views out over the Quoich to the mist-shrouded slopes of Beinn a’ Bhuird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXhkH7" title="Slugain Ruin by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slugain Ruin" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8247/8501876588_428a56ca1f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low cloud made this high moorland more wild and lonely feeling than usual and it was comforting to found the occassional traces of a track as I headed first north towards Ben Avon before turning eastward to climb up towards the watershed that leads to Glen Gairn. The burbling of the grouse was the only sound that broke the silence in this wild, lonely place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXbCm6" title="The Glen Gairn Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Glen Gairn Track" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8530/8500761885_b627720e23_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the watershed the path was difficult to follow and I ended up weaving up and down and around hillocks and through deep drifting slow until I reached the narrowing in Glen Gairn where the preciptious slopes of Cairn Liath and Ben Avon almost meet and where I finally picked up the track again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXbA2t" title="Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Gairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8500754077_acd1f94309_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I crossed the Gairn for the first time as the track took to the eastern bank and then passed below the steep slopes of Cairn Liath. There were occassional traces of avalanche runout but the slopes were largely stripped of snow. At path level there was still plenty to negotiate but the track was easy to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXbyd8" title="Track through Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Gairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8500747967_a75203a254_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the narrow glen the chill wind was channelled unpleasantly and so it was good to get into the more open part of Glen Gairn where, after crossing the river again, I made further progress eastward before stopping for some food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXhcZb" title="The River Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The River Gairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8501850608_6d7983a79a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With restored energy levels I now made my way along the glen, following a track which was snow-covered in places, and just muddy in others. Whenever a side stream crossed the path I was at risk of dropping several feet through slushy snow and into the water below. Eventually I took to crossing these areas on all fours! I was glad to finally reach the bridge which marked the point at which I would start heading south to complete the loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side a track headed south towards the Bealach Dubh but at some point I made a wrong decision and ended up doing a stretch of cross country until I finally picked up the narrow line of the track which climbed up to the high point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddle between Culardoch brought with it spectacular views of the White Mounth, just starting to catch sun as the clouds broke. Lochnagar was shrouded in cloud but as I followed the vehicle track south more and more of the hills emerged until I was looking at a vast panorama of the Deeside hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dXbTfz" title="Sunlight over the Mounth by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight over the Mounth" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8500812025_c2f9d05520_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrone was visible and then Lochnagar’s summit finally emerged from the cloud. Soon the sunlight reached me and as I dropped towards the head of Glen Feadar I was removing layers and thoroughly enjoying the views all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hints of blue sky appeared over Cairn Liath behind me as I wound my way up towards the col below Meikle Gorm. The track was snow covered and the passage of quad bikes made the going a little tough but soon I started to reach stretches of woodland where the shelter meant the track was free of snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were now views westward down Glen Dee and back towards Slugain and Carn na Drochaide. The track emerged from the woods and the snow seemed to be even deeper than before on this sheltered side of the hills. Eventually though I reached the Invercauld woods and swiftly dropped down through the pine-needle littered slopes to reach the estate road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short stretch of tarmac brought me back to the car where the pleasant temperatures followed me back to Aberdeen after a short but pleasant outing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hillwalking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="winter"></category><category term="snow"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>Hogmanay Hoolie Above Glen Ernan</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/01/glen-ernan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-04T20:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2013-01-04T20:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-01-04:/blog/2013/01/glen-ernan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A loop of the hills around Glen Ernan including some interesting views of familiar hills in the Cairngorms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2nd January 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 17.48km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 544m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 4 hrs 30 mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills:  Cairn Vachich, Gael Charn, Carn Mor&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Early rain giving way to sunshine. Very gusty wind. Mild.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hillwalk of 2013 started amidst wind and rain as Dave and I headed down Glen Ernan from a start just off the main Strathdon road. Thirty minutes later we were peeling back sodden hoods to gaze up in amazement at the blue sky that had appeared overhead. The glen, at first wide and fertile, narrowed and started twisting about the feet of the encroaching hills. We stopped for a snack and then pressed on, following the easy track until we reached the shiel in the upper glen. This turned out to be a rather smart estate building and attendant bothy, both freshly painted but sadly locked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we forded the burn and followed the vehicle track west up icy slopes and then across short heather, scattering snow-white mountain hares, to reach the summit of Carn Vachich where we enjoyed panoramic views. Our eyes were drawn to the snowy bulwark of Ben Avon, its top shrouded in cloud but sun catching its glistening flanks. Close by the ski paraphernalia at the Lecht could be seen and to the south were the hills above the Gairnshiel road, the snaking tarmac reflecting the low winter sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dHvPve" title="The ford across the Ernan Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The ford across the Ernan Water" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8076/8346075603_75ce800cd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By clever design (or by sheer luck - you decide) we were now heading back towards the car with the gusting wind behind us. A network of estate tracks criss-cross these hills but we mainly stuck to the pathless ridgeline, heading south to Gael Charn. A dark cloud over the Ladder hills bypassed us to the east and more of the Cairngorms became visible as the weather blew through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dGLDvK" title="To the Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="To the Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8359/8337652177_6358bb8626_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shelter on Gael Charn proved draughty and unstable so we enjoyed lunch outside it in the sunshine where, hunkered down, we were out of the wind. From here we followed the surprisingly distinct ridge towards the giant cairn on Carn Mor. We now had views to a cloud-capped Morven away to the south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dHBxWu" title="Gael Charn Summit by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gael Charn Summit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8055/8347193916_be647ce5cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final hill was guarded by a steep descent and re-ascent but eventually the cairn was reached and its sheltered side gave us a chance to look at the map and decide on a way down. Rather than backtrack to an easy path we decided to continue along the ridge, soon dropping into a sparse pine wood which then gave out to thigh-deep trackless heather and low growing conifers that slowed our pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dHBRKh" title="Morven by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morven" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8468/8347253818_a3b446ba5c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the far side of the last rise we picked out a route down to the woods above the main road. Out of the wind it was very warm and we were glad to come across a narrow track which dropped through the trees and eventually brought us to the main road and so back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped off at the quirky &lt;a href="http://bonnysocks.co.uk/"&gt;Mossatburn Tea Room&lt;/a&gt; for a spot of cake and a great big pot of a tea served by the cheerful proprietress. We drove back to Aberdeen in the golden hour as the low sun set over the hills, a light mist playing in the hollows, and the Loch of Skene looking dazzling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent way to blow away the cobwebs of Christmas and New Year and get a new year of hills off to a fine start.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hillwalking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="photo"></category><category term="strathdon"></category></entry><entry><title>The Glenlivet Hills</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/11/glenlivet-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-25T22:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-11-25T22:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-11-25:/blog/2012/11/glenlivet-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A loop of the hills around Glenlivet including a Graham (Cook’s Cairn) and Corbett (Corryhabbie Hill)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car was cosily warm after the drive over from Aberdeen and it took until the sun crested the distant hills for me to reluctantly leave behind its easy comforts. The temperature showed a chilly −1&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

&lt;p&gt;Once moving I warmed up nicely, and the pleasant sunrise provided some stunning illumination of a sparkling world. After overcoming a few navigational challenges I was on the right track, walking along besides the River Livet and enjoying the peace and quiet of this early morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdH3T" title="Waymarkers in Glen Livet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waymarkers in Glen Livet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8200/8229572027_59ec90e9f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Livet the track continued on the west bank of the river, moving away from the farmhouses and into more open countryside. Before I reached the shadow cast by the hills I stopped for a hot drink and some food, gazing out over the Braes of Glenlivet as the sun lit up the frosty heathery and bog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjcrj" title="River Livet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Livet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8204/8230643080_a44415170a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdKVp" title="Morning Sunshine by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning Sunshine" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8229581685_230760cbc2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdNja" title="Glenlivet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glenlivet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8229589733_0b8262c1d2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing the turn off for the Smugglers Route to Burnside of Thain I turned the corner into the narrower upper reaches of the Glen with the abandoned farmhouse of Suie visible further up the slope. This is now the route of both the &lt;a href="http://www.heritagepaths.co.uk/keywordSearchResults.php?keywords=suie&amp;amp;x=0&amp;amp;y=0"&gt;Steplar and Glenfiddich Road&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdNxP" title="Smugglers Trail Sign by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Smugglers Trail Sign" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8229590525_b9bfd047da_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdPtT" title="The River Livet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The River Livet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8229593661_bf5b4ed949_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broad track forded the Kymah Burn at this point but I continued on, following a fainter track to reach the bridge over the stream just at the empty farmhouse of Knochkan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjjmh" title="Knochkan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Knochkan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8230666336_c4a8578b25_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjjAj" title="Farmhouse at Knochkan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Farmhouse at Knochkan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8348/8230667150_8d562f4418_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdSh6" title="Carn na Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn na Bruar" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8229603069_5daa9e5bd4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A faint path continued up the Livet, staying close to the River. As I climbed higher into the glen the ground became increasingly boggy and the path was soon lost amongst heather and grasses. A high deer face provided an easy line to follow and eventually I found a gate through it that permitted me access to the slopes beyond Carn an Bruar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdTPv" title="Above the River Livet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Above the River Livet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8229608255_f1982da52a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjoaC" title="Carn na Bruar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn na Bruar" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8490/8230679174_b18970c1b5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjoQh" title="Glenlivet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glenlivet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8203/8230681416_d77edc6674_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I climbed up through heather to join a faint track that climbed up to the plateau high above the River Livet. This opened up a view of a vast, rolling countryside stretching out to the hills of Cabrach and Rhynie. My original plan had been to turn here and climb Carn an Bruar but on inspecting the map I couldn’t resist the idea of heading over to a hill called Kneedeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdXck" title="Kneedeep by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kneedeep" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8229619613_04dfd26893_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjrSL" title="Towards Cook's Cairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Cook's Cairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8197/8230691652_0a880e34ce_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxdZGV" title="The Blackwater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Blackwater" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8479/8229628057_7d6d9c041a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traverse across boggy ground, thankfully frozen, brought me gently up to this obscure and unmarked summit which enjoyed fine views out over the Blackwater forest and to the Buck of Cabrach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Kneedeep I now made my way through rough heather north to cross the deep trench carved by the Allt na Craoibhe-cuilinn as it flowed down to join the Blackwater. Once on the other side it was then an easy pull up to the summit of Carn na Bruar through peat hags and frozen bogs as the views out over the Braes of Glenlivet and the cloudy Cairngorms opened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxe1Lp" title="Allt na Craoibhe-cuilinn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt na Craoibhe-cuilinn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/8229631623_194ec46ba5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxe3hP" title="Cloud over the Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over the Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8229636751_7e32aa2085_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the vantage point overlooking Glenlivet and Glen Suie I headed along the plateau to another set of cairns which gave excellent views to the day’s next hill, Cook’s Cairn. This was easily reached by a high bealach where I joined a vehicle track coming up from Glen Suie (the Steplar).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjyjq" title="Carn na Bruar Summit by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn na Bruar Summit" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8230713324_29a03a8b14_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjzwq" title="Track to Cook's Cairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track to Cook's Cairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8060/8230717384_f9ff3655e1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving the main track heading over to the Blackwater a fainter track took me up to the summit of Cook’s Cairn with the views back out over the Cairngorms opening up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjBsN" title="Beinn Rinnes and Cook's Cairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Rinnes and Cook's Cairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8201/8230723902_cbbb13552c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxeagM" title="Summit of Cook's Cairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Cook's Cairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8208/8229660239_f9fccea38c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjCBf" title="The Aberdeenshire Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Aberdeenshire Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8479/8230727756_387885a90c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite giving its name to the hill the cairn was not that substantial and there was a cold wind blowing at this point. Thankfully the sun was just about shining through increasingly thick high cloud and so a chilly lunch was consumed looking out across these big rolling hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxebBe" title="Sunlight over the Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight over the Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8229664731_0ca3f1e9d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxecuc" title="Corryhabbie Hill across Glenlivet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corryhabbie Hill across Glenlivet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8064/8229667687_19e25db149_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next target was Corryhabbie Hill, perched across the far side of upper Gle Suie. Steep heathery slopes on the north side of Cook’s Cairn were carefully descended and then there was a boggy section to cross before regaining the landrover track (the Glenfiddich Road). A branch took me immediately up the hillside, a series of switchbacks gaining me height with relative ease as the views back down Glen Suie developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxedoc" title="The Glenfiddich Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Glenfiddich Track" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8229670703_41c3a7787a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjH31" title="Glen Livet by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Livet" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8230742648_4dca961a1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I approached the plateau the world turned increasingly snowy with a thin, frosty layer covering track and surrounding heather. Beinn Rinnes came into view to the north east. Eventually I reached the junction with Morton’s Way which heads north towards Glenfiddich. I turned south, and soon reached the large structure marking the top of Corryhabbie Hill. Inside a large stone cairn was a trig point, with, a metal hat on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxehvR" title="Beinn Rinnes by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Rinnes" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8482/8229684603_f18bc69340_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxegYZ" title="Winter Sun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Winter Sun" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8345/8229682813_fd4373367f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxei6g" title="Bend in the road by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bend in the road" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8480/8229686541_72abd923b5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again there was a chill wind blowing and with the sun sinking towards the horizon it was much colder than my spot at lunch. I had just a short break to have another hot drink and some chocolate before continuing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxem2Z" title="Northwest from Corryhabbie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northwest from Corryhabbie Hill" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8229696443_a8564ded83_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjPyy" title="Winter Afternoon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Winter Afternoon" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8477/8230764604_7f6b271b6f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time the cloud swathed over the Cairngorms was breaking up and I could start to see the individual peaks emerging, clad in their Alpine raiment. Ahead of me snaked the Carn an t-Suidhe ridge which would lead me back to Glenlivet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxenck" title="The Carn an t-Suidhe Ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Carn an t-Suidhe Ridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8202/8229700349_bbe4ca6a6f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxenyk" title="Beinn Rinnes by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Rinnes" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8067/8229701567_41bf3cd327_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjQWq" title="Corryhabbie Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corryhabbie Hill" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8230769236_0bcc844507_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an initial boggy section I soon reached close cropped heather and this allowed for easy progress along the ridge. Eventually I reached the final cairn and stopped for a few minutes to admire the sweeping views out over the Cairngorms. It is a magnificent viewpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjRo1" title="West from Carn an t-Suidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="West from Carn an t-Suidhe" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8341/8230770720_a4398ea545_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxjRHN" title="Carn an t-Suidhe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn an t-Suidhe" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8230771868_4eab714f5d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was a case of picking my way downhill, aiming all the time for the bridge that I had crossed earlier in the day. The going was good and as I got closer to the river I picked up a faint trail which led me directly back to the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dxepVt" title="The Bochel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Bochel" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8229709521_ba2a2c77f3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the high cloud thickened and lowered the day came to an end in a gloomy, grey sort of way. It was still cold though and I was glad to quickly cover the last mile and get back to the car. There didn’t seem much prospect of a sunset so I was soon on the road and heading home. Of course, in my rear view mirror the most amazing sunset appeared a few minutes later, the very lowest clouds burning a bright red. I stopped the car to get a final shot before darkness descended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning dawned cold and clear in Aberdeen. A close conjunction of Venus and the waning Moon hung low in the eastern sky as I walked to the meeting point for the November Stocket hillwalk. There a gathering of Stockets was lacking only one thing: a coach. After a couple of phone calls the confusion was sorted out and twenty-five minutes later we were on a warm coach heading west down Deeside under beautiful morning skies. Pockets of frost and a low running river were both remarked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning dawned cold and clear in Aberdeen. A close conjunction of Venus and the waning Moon hung low in the eastern sky as I walked to the meeting point for the November Stocket hillwalk. There a gathering of Stockets was lacking only one thing: a coach. After a couple of phone calls the confusion was sorted out and twenty-five minutes later we were on a warm coach heading west down Deeside under beautiful morning skies. Pockets of frost and a low running river were both remarked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUKJh" title="Autumn Tree by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Autumn Tree" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8338/8192119536_dc94d211ba_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At Inverey we jumped off the coach, heading a short distance further down the road before turning onto a forest track just before Muir Cottage. The tall pines had dropped an orange carpet of pine needles and we followed the track which climbs quite steeply up the hillside. Blue skies were glimpsed above the trees and the oranges and reds of autumn were lit up by the sunshine. It was remarkably pleasant after the chilly start to the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtPcck" title="Autumn trees near Inverey by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Autumn trees near Inverey" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8488/8191034533_2b7d625588_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the forest the clear track turned into a boggy set of vehicle tracks through the heather. On the first summit we paused to regroup and then continued west slightly to find a place to stop and mark remembrance Sunday. The views had opened up by now with Ben Avon and Beinn a’ Bhuird snow-covered under brilliant blue skies and the central Cairngorms sitting under cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 11am we stopped to observe two minutes of silence, looking out over the Cairngorms as snow flurries swept up the Geldie and shrouded the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUSWE" title="Snow over the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow over the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8199/8192143802_76ce86db24_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUTMU" title="The track to Carn Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Carn Liath" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8192146658_42a27a1ba8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ridge provided easy walking; short clipped heather and a clear track at times. Though we were walking into the wind it wasn’t unpleasant and we made good progress along the ridge to Carn Liath, all of the time watching as the view into the Lairig Ghru developed. Finally we climbed the final gentle slope to the grey, bouldery summit of the day’s high point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUVfJ" title="The River Dee and Beinn Bhrotain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The River Dee and Beinn Bhrotain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8057/8192151578_c02f871ed4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed the blustery views out to Beinn  a’ Ghlo in the south and then further west and north across the Tarf Munros to the meandering line of the Geldie and the high rolling hills of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUVA5" title="Beinn a' Ghlo by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Ghlo" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8343/8192152700_2929c717de_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtPn8D" title="The Geldie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Geldie" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8068/8191067959_1527eec95b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bitter wind didn’t encourage much hanging around on this exposed summit and so after a brief pause we headed south, descending to the bealach at the head of the Allt Cristie Beag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtUXp1" title="Towards Carn Bhac by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Carn Bhac" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8066/8192158786_8b0070f122_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contoured around and onto the ridge leading to Buchaille Breage, hopping bogs and watching as a large herd of deer started to get wind of our scent. They streamed away north towards the Geldie as we approached. The view north continued to be outstanding with our position now giving us a clear view up the river Dee to the Devil’s Point standing guard before the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtPrmg" title="Carn Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn Liath" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8337/8191082147_74f716f375_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Buchaille Breag there were just another couple of heathery summits to cross and then we were standing at the final cairn of the day, looking south towards Beinn a’ Ghlo as a weak sun struggled to penetrate the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtV6Mh" title="Beinn a' Ghlo and the Tilt's headwaters by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Ghlo and the Tilt's headwaters" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8486/8192186990_f58d41c4b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent was initially steep but then we picked up an easy grassy ramp that I had spotted on a previous visit to this area. We quickly got down to the stream which was easily forded without getting feet wet. It was then a short walk along the track to reach the ruins of Bynack Lodge and our lunch stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtPu9X" title="Looking towards the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking towards the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8478/8191091583_e2c4df676c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suitably refreshed after sandwiches consumed whilst leaning against the ruined walls of the lodge we now headed north, first fording the Bynack Burn and then the more difficult Geldie Burn. Neither was particularly fast flowing but the water was up to knee high in places and very, very cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dtPCQv" title="Leaving Bynack Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leaving Bynack Lodge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/8191120789_1e9fe9caa6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now the easy amble out, first to White Bridge and then along the northern bank of the Dee back to where the coach was waiting near the Linn. The sun sank lower and although there wasn’t much of a sunset the peace and quiet that descended over the glen certainly made for a pleasant end to the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant pint in front of a roaring log fire at the Fife Arms in Braemar we were back on the coach for a quick drive back to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hillwalking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="photo"></category></entry><entry><title>The Dubh-Ghleann Circuit</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/10/the-dubh-ghleann-circuit/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-21T18:16:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-10-21T18:16:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-10-21:/blog/2012/10/the-dubh-ghleann-circuit/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A circuit of the hills in the eastern Cairngorms with an overnight camp on Beinn a’ Bhuird&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four weeks ago I was supposed to be in Assynt, enjoying the wild lands of the far north and climbing my halfway Munro. My car however had different ideas, breaking down and leaving me stranded in Aberdeen on a sunny Friday. It took two weeks and more money than I really care to think about to sort it out but at least I have a car again. For my return to camping trips I wasn’t up for something as distant as Assynt, instead I chose to head back to my favourite stomping ground, the Cairngorms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four weeks ago I was supposed to be in Assynt, enjoying the wild lands of the far north and climbing my halfway Munro. My car however had different ideas, breaking down and leaving me stranded in Aberdeen on a sunny Friday. It took two weeks and more money than I really care to think about to sort it out but at least I have a car again. For my return to camping trips I wasn’t up for something as distant as Assynt, instead I chose to head back to my favourite stomping ground, the Cairngorms. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was mid-August 2009 that I was last on the summit of one of the eastern giants of the range - Beinn a’ Bhuird and Ben Avon - which occupy a vast tract of land between Braemar and Tomintoul. Earlier this year I walked down Glen Gairn with the hope of heading up to Ben Avon but was forced by high winds and low cloud to stay low that day. This had made me keener than ever to reacquaint myself with these high, wild mountains which, whilst less popular than their neighbours, certainly don’t lack for character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading to the Aberdeen side of the Cairngorms generally affords for a leisurely start, and this one was no different. Despite rising early I didn’t hit the road until just after 9. There was patchy sunshine along Deeside and as it came into view above Ballater I could see that the upper reaches of Lochnagar had a substantial plastering of snow. At the Linn of Quoich parking area the car thermometer promised a chilly 7 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do5xrR" title="Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Quoich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8333/8126130359_16065083da_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glen Quoich is a perfect Cairngorm glen. More enclosed than neighbouring Lui, it’s also less well visited, particularly away from the car park and Punch Bowl, and yet it still has all the classic ingredients of a Cairngorm glen. A river chatters through a mix of green pine and golden birchwoods whilst the big hills crowd around the far end. The vehicle track on the west side of the glen makes for gentle progress in and I took my time, enjoying the sights and smells of autumn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do5yQe" title="Quoich Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quoich Water" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8056/8126135021_5f908db913_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the closed bridge I paused for a lunchbreak, the water racing through the narrow linn, and the sunlight breaking through the trees. It was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do5Rrb" title="Quoich Water in Autumn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quoich Water in Autumn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8323/8126190872_c5fafda7fd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I carried on at an easy pace down the glen, enjoying the evolving views as first Beinn Bhreac and then Beinn a’ Bhuird came into sight. The river crossing was straightforward with just a slight toe wetting to deal with and then it was onwards, climbing up through the short strand of Scots Pine and then up the open hillside onto the long ridge of An Diollard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do5UEZ" title="Beinn Bhreac and Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Bhreac and Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8196/8126201765_d1218107a0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corrie was sombre and still but coming out onto more open ground brought with it wonderful views down the length of the Dubh-Ghleann towards the big peaks of the central Cairngorms. Below me the allt wound its way below the slopes of Beinn Bhreac and down to the point where I had crossed it back down in Glen Quoich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do64jK" title="The An Diollard Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The An Diollard Track" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8466/8126230867_1491ffacb1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly higher up and now out of the protection of the corrie the wind was much colder and more blustery. However, the views continued to develop and I was now looking out across the vast marshy land marking the watershed between the heads of the Dubh Glen and the glen of the Cumh na Choinnich and distant Glen Derry. Here was the long march of the central Cairngorms, from Derry on the left to Bynack More on the right, from the distinctive tors on Beinn Mheadhoin and across the dark cliffs surrounding Loch Etchachan towards a sparkling white Ben MacDui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do6a5r" title="The Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8126250221_7837b3bb78_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued my way up the easy slope, pausing every now and then to watch as the views developed and the afternoon light changed below an increasingly complex arrangement of clouds strung out over a blue sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gentle rising path eventually brought me out on the barren, windswept plateau. Close at hand was the lip of the Dubh Coire with the dark cliffs of A’ Chioch rising up to the south. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do6mKB" title="Plateau of Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plateau of Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8051/8126289497_2450a0cdc3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far below the Dubh Lochan was a cold and sombre blue, reflecting the moody colours of the sky. The  plateau was crusted with a couple of inches of snow, windswept, barren and with not a single other person in sight. I made my way north now, following the line of the cliffs and gazing down into each passing coire. The tors on Ben Avon provided the backdrop and further off Lochnagar was occassionally glimpsed below low-set cloud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underfoot conditions weren’t ideal for trail shoes but I made progress and eventually the plateau rose gently to the cairn marking the north top of Beinn a’ Bhuird. A minimalist cairn, more a pile of rocks than anything else, marks this 1,179m high Munro and offered little in the way of shelter from the wind. Nevertheless it was good to sit, hunkered down against the chill, and enjoy a chocolate bar whilst looking out at the long crest of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do6MGu" title="Summit cairn of Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit cairn of Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8468/8126373416_cf7c9a4cb1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had only a vague plan for a camping spot and although the hour was still relatively early, with the wind blowing about I wanted to be sure I was relatively sheltered once the tent was pitched. I briefly toyed with the idea of heading over to Ben Avon but was already thinking that the views of the Cairngorms would be better if I headed west the next day and so decided to stay on Beinn a’ Bhuird. By this time I had crossed east from the summit, passing the head of the distinctive twin burns where I finally found a little more shelter from the wind. I passed to the west of the Beinn’ a Bhuird’s most easterly top, Cnap a Chleirich, and then dropped down northwards towards another rocky tor, Stob an t-Sluichd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do6Nbb" title="Ben Avon from Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Avon from Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8126375022_1733edbc6b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, I came across another burn and beyond it a grassy rise with stunning views over the Slochd Mor to Ben Avon’s summit. I briefly continued on towards the Stob but as the wind rose again and the ground became rockier, I turned back to the grassy rise where the comination of views, slight shelter and water persuaded me to pitch for the night. Despite the fact it was only 4pm I was pleased with my location and despite an unruly breeze quickly got the tent up. With a windbreak available I got the stove on in the tent porch for a cup of tea, the first of several hot drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the afternoon turned to evening the skies grew cloudier. The wind died a little and I had a wander round the local area. The hills were dusky with a hint of pink, especially north over Moray where the distinctive shape of Ben Rinnes was clearly seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do73Y7" title="Northern Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8053/8126424782_327dd5e094_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was cold though and I soon retired back to the tent for dinner. After a Fuizion meal I got through a few chapters of &lt;em&gt;A Feast for Crows&lt;/em&gt; on my Kindle and then snuggled down into my down sleeping bag to listen to a &lt;a href="http://allwhowander.us/014-all-who-wander-big-sky-country-part-1-flight-to-bozeman/"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.theoutdoorsstation.co.uk/2012/10/no-351-reviewing-hard-copy-maps-and-ebooks/"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading outside briefly to brush my teeth I found it was still cloudy outside with a breeze still coming in from the southwest. For a few minutes a gap in the clouds revealed the glorious arc of the Milky Way and the constellations of Perseus, Cassiopea and Cygnus. All too soon though more cloud had swept in and as the stars faded from view I zipped back up the tent and settled down to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do6YDX" title="Dawn over the Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dawn over the Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8186/8126410273_74a637b3fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had warmed up during the night and woke amidst a pile of socks and insulation layers that had been scattered about the tent. There was the palest of lights on the tent walls and I opened up the east door to find the most stunning pre-dawn sky. A deep orange band stretched across the gap between Ben Avon and Beinn a’ Bhuird whilst the hilltops remained silhouetted against a depthless indigo sky. A few bright stars shone in the sky and Venus was a dazzling point above Cnap a’ Chleirich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly entertained the notion of staying in bed and getting another half hour of sleep but the beauty of the dawn persuaded me to throw on all my layers and bundle myself out of the tent. There was a bitingly cold breeze but it was less gusty than the previous evening. I warmed myself up with a round of the area, getting the views as the light slowly changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do7aUd" title="Dawn over Cnap a' Chleirich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dawn over Cnap a' Chleirich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8186/8126448104_71ec2a7cab_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunrise was still sometime off but the changing views kept me occupied. A thick layer of cloud was billowing up from Deeside, running along Ben Avon and spilling over the Sneck like a slow-motion waterfall. It swirled around the granite summit tors and then disappeared as it headed further north. Meanwhile, dappled clouds filled the sky overhead and these lightened in color before turning pink as the sun finally crested Ben Avon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cup of coffee in hand I watched as the sun rose above the drifting clouds. The landscape was suddenly illuminated; the rocks and grasses and mosses shining golden and splendid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dmP6qQ" title="Wild Camping on Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping on Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8193/8111799660_816fa259a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day was looking promising and so after breakfast I quickly got everything packed away and was striding out across the icy plateau a little after 8am. The good weather confirmed my plan to strike west and complete the circuit of the Dubh-Ghleann, picking up the two Munros on the east side of Glen Derry which I had climbed back in February 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do7iga" title="Sunlight over the Sneck by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight over the Sneck" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8465/8126472867_e0bffe993f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the walk was through an icy wonderland. Blue skies overhead and sunlight catching a million ice crystals. I made good progress across the plateau but as I reached the gentle western slopes of Beinn a’ Bhuird found that the first of a series of cloud patches had swept in from the south, enclosing me in a thick and cloying mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do7tQy" title="North from Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="North from Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8044/8126508444_172cb02529_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating on compass I set myself a series of bearings that took me down a broad ridge, descending through slushy snow and then onto bare grass. I passed by a crescent lochan and then dropped down to the head of the Allt Cumh na Choinnich. Here I dropped below the cloud into a land of browns and russets with a chattering stream heading north towards the Avon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do7ofz" title="Lochan west of Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan west of Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8471/8126489653_a44bd55392_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I crossed the steep-sided gorge and then climbed out on the other side picking up the outlying ridge of Beinn a’ Chaorainn Beag. The cloud began to thin and lift as I climbed higher and soon I could see the outline of Beinn a’ Bhuird behind me and the vast, watery expanse of the Moine Bheadlaidh stretched out to the south. As I approached the summit the cloud drifted off completely and I was left slack jawed as I crested the ridge with stunning views out over the northern Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cairn offered some shelter from the cold wind and I took the opportunity to rest, admiring the views and eating a few jelly babies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the next band of clouds rolled in I left the summit, dropping down to the grouping of lochans on the saddle and then climbing up the slopes to Beinn a’ Chaorainn and the second Munro summit of the trip. The cloud was a bit more stubborn here but I continued to get glimpses of the hills across the Lairig an Laoigh including Bynack More and Beinn Mheadhoin with Cairn Gorm further off and plastered in snow. South I got some views of Beinn Bhreac across the shimmering moss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bitter wind soon got the better of me and I started my descent in the mist. Last time I had been in this area the ground was covered in snow and progress had been reasonable. Now the bogs were wet and inviting and I had to take a less than direct route to keep to the higher and slightly drier ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do7RGS" title="Mist over the Moine Bhealaidh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over the Moine Bhealaidh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8335/8126582006_8baa8ac409_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off to my right I watched as the cloud gradually lifted off of the Derry group, the cliffs surrounding Loch Etchachan looked dark and forbidding. Behind me Beinn a’ Chaorainn was shedding its covering of mist and the blue sky was streaked with huge sweeping cloud formations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do82yR" title="Etchachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Etchachan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8467/8126615181_a9685948f9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise up to Beinn Bhreac’s west top afforded me better views down Glen Derry and I paused for a bite of lunch looking back north and east over the hills I had traversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do8hdJ" title="The Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cairngorms" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8323/8126664474_5f60fd322c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up on the summit the sun was now shining and the day was much warmer. The Cairngorms had largely shaken off their cloud and I marvelled at the clarity of the air and the views. South away from me the mountains stretched towards a misty Perthshire with Lochnagar dominating the east and Beinn a’ Ghlo in the west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do8i1X" title="Cairn Toul and Derry Cairngorm by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Toul and Derry Cairngorm" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8043/8126667155_07b78a95a2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to stay high for as long as possible so from Beinn Bhreac I descended easy slopes south and slightly west to the col between Bhreac and Meall an Lundain. I then climbed the heathery slopes of this overlooked hill and found myself drawn back to the views down Glen Derry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A neat and sizeable cairn marked the summit of this broad hill and then it was down the southeastern ridge towards the river in Glen Quoich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do8NTj" title="Summit of Meall an Lundain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Meall an Lundain" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8323/8126767632_e8fdbf6ab3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upper hill was easy and I was able to follow various deer tracks down through the heather. Lower down as I got closer to the streams the ground became boggier and more uneven. Eventually I found myself crossing a fence and then thrashing through a meadow until I came out on the good footpath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do8WQu" title="The Dubh-Ghleann by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Dubh-Ghleann" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8049/8126794380_06b48a8a24_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a few hundred metres lower and in the shelter of the valley it was appreciably warmer and I took off a good few layers before getting the stove on for a final brew. The burn chattered away lazily and I took the opportunity to have a wash and freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do8QsK" title="Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8190/8126772935_caea538fb8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was just a simple case of following my outward route back through Glen Quoich to the car. As the afternoon progressed the warm sunshine dipped below the surrounding hills but the trees held on to some lingering heat and I never felt chilly. The glorious autumnal colours were even more striking than the day before and although it was good to get back to the car I wished I had the time to linger in this most wonderful of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/do95Ho" title="Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8325/8126820880_c3c53a4db8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a great way to break a long stretch without being in the mountains and the variety of weather and views meant that the trip, despite being just over 28 hours in length, felt a bit longer. Though winter seems to be fast encroaching I’m hopeful of at least one more autumnal camp before the snow really sets in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to traverse a mountain range in a day is a rare one and is definitely one of the main reasons why I am a member of the &lt;a href="http://www.stockets.org.uk"&gt;Stocket Hillwalking Club&lt;/a&gt;. The club’s 2012 Cairngorm Traverse was an opportunity to cross the Cairngorms, either via the famous pass of the Lairig Ghru, or going across the Cairn Toul massif to bag the Devil’s Peak, Cairn Toul and Sgorr an Lochain Uaine. Despite the fact that I had been up in this area &lt;a href="/blog/2012/08/breaking-the-curse-of-braeriach/"&gt;wild camping just a couple of weeks before&lt;/a&gt; I was still thoroughly looking forward to this day out, especially as the weather promised to be rather good. Would it be, as with Braeriach on the last occasion, third time lucky for a summit view from Cairn Toul?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather took a little time to sort itself out and the situation wasn’t helped by our super speedy bus driver who got us through to the Linn of Dee for 8:30am, a little earlier than expected given our 7am departure! A little light drizzle was falling as we set off through the pine woods, but the sun was shining at times and it was already turning into a warm day. The walk along the Derry Road was enlivened by the shifting light but it was good to get to the lodge where we had a short break before the midges could get too settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cUJbpu" title="Rainbow by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8303/7816611946_a7477a8c8d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chased several rainbows along the line of the Luibeg, the sun lighting up the wonderfully purple heather as the dark shadows of clouds chased each other across the higher tops. Last summer I did almost no hillwalking and had forgotten the vivid colours that transform this usually somewhat drab, brown-grey landscape into a place of endless beauty. Everything from the very tops of the hills to the deepest depths of the streams was alive with colour and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Luibeg, flowing strongly with startlingly clear water, was forded without too much trouble and then we were climbing up and over the shoulder of Carn a’ Mhaim and down into Glen Dee. The weather was improving with every step forward, although the scudding clouds meant that the light was dramatic and ever changing. The waterproof jackets were put away, stuffed into the bottom of the pack, and forgotten about for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking into the bottom of the Lairig Ghru is always a marvellous experience, the big mountains, bigger than anything outside of Ben Nevis, rise up on either side, their flanks the soft red-pink of the Monadh Ruadh. Glen Geusachan was dark beneath the clouds but as we approached the bothy at Corrour sunlight broke over the Devil’s Point, lighting up the cloud that was clinging to the summit of Cairn Toul towering above this tiny, isolated shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Corrour we paused for a bite of lunch. There was a chill wind blowing down from the Ghru which did a reasonable job of keeping the worst of the midges away but did mean an extra layer had to go on. To warm up again we had the joy of the ascent up through Corrie Odhair on the excellent gravel track which winds its way up besides the tumbling stream. I took the opportunity to refill my water at the crossing above the falls, enjoying the views up the Lairig Ghru to the rounded summit of Ben MacDui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I ascended I passed a group of Australian lads who were lumbering up the steep slope under heavy packs. They were on a multi-night Cairngorm adventure and really enjoying it despite the weight of their loads. Shooting by them I quickly reached the bealach and, following the same path I descended in the deep dusk two weeks before, got to the summit of the Devil’s Point to enjoy some solace. It was breezy but the views were endless, disappearing off into a haze of hills in far off Perthshire. The Geusachan shimmered, a slender sliver of water coursing its way into the Dee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7Dsgd" title="Ben Macdui across Glen Dee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Macdui across Glen Dee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8448/7951487682_95210df679_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the bealach and then northward, following the rim of the cliffs to point 1213 and then up to the summit of Cairn Toul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cUxxE9" title="Summit of Cairn Toul by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Cairn Toul" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7277/7814537208_1dbb35d533_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third time lucky it was and from the summit cairn there were glorious views in all directions. I took a brief stroll down the northeast ridge to look out over the Green Lochan and across the Lairig Ghru. Braeriach and Ben MacDui dominated the scene their scree-covered flanks basking pink in the sunshine and thin ribbons of white water tumbling down their riven gullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7E4jN" title="The Lairig Ghru from Cairn Toul's northeast ridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lairig Ghru from Cairn Toul's northeast ridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8462/7951605630_657c8fe1d4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the cairn I now had a good long wait for everyone else to catch up. The chill wind remained so I hunkered down behind the cairn to eat some food. Members of an RAF SAR team up and puttered about on the summit for a while before disppaearing off again. A group of three walkers who had cycled in at the same time as us also arrived before pressing on to the Angel’s Peak.
Regrouped and fed we followed suit, picking our way clumsily through the loose and jumbled boulders before puffing our way up the track to the summit of Sgurr an Lochan Uaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7kgPj" title="From Cairn Toul by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="From Cairn Toul" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/7947940524_a14d9102e1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit of the Angel’s Peak provided another wonderful spot for a break, the views out over the immense Garbh Coire to the tumbling Falls of Dee and the crags and cliffs of Braeriach drawing the eye as much as the Lairig Ghru and Ben MacDui now off to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7Evzf" title="The Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8445/7951693932_aba682a3f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We descended down more boulders to the col between the Angel’s Peak and Einich Cairn. Here was our last views of the central Caingorms with an impressive view across the Garbh Coire to the Falls of Dee and along to Braeriach’s summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7EL5J" title="Falls of Dee and Braeriach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Falls of Dee and Braeriach" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8316/7951742738_a662ea8b1c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now left the high, harsh land of the plateau and contoured round the flanks of Einich Cairn on a faint track that kept us high above the Allt Luineag. The sunshine remained and we enjoyed the views over the boggy land to Beinn Bhrotain and Monadh Mor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7EPXd" title="Above the Allt Luineag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Above the Allt Luineag" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8170/7951755758_182cf6f7b9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path petered out but it was simple enough to contour around until we could spot the cairn marking the head of the descent through Coire Dondhail which would take us down into Glen Einich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7EUKG" title="The track to Glen Einich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Glen Einich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8040/7951771910_7a31187dd0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stalker’s path is most excellent, at least once past a slippery section through the crags, and we were soon enjoying the views up Loch Einich to the dark cliffs of Sgor Gaoith. As we descended the evening sunlight lit up the waters of the loch and the wonderful wild flowers growing alongside the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7kie1" title="Loch Einich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8035/7947945262_7700ab247b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk out was long but straightforward. The hills were bathed in late afternoon sunshine and the thought of a cold beer at the pub draw us on, through Glen Einich, through the Rothiemurchas forest, and finally down into Coylumbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/d7FfXs" title="Glen Einich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Einich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8029/7951839872_ec6058ea1b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were weary feet by the end but it had been a stunning day and some of the best conditions I’d experienced in the Cairngorms. The journey back was sleep filled after a couple of well earned pints and it was in deep darkness that we arrived back in Aberdeen, a long but rewarding day complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 4th August 2012&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 22.23km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,678m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 10hr 15min&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Braeriach (Munro), Angel's Peak (Munro), Cairn Toul (Munro), Devil's Point (Munro)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than perhaps getting up to head on holiday, 4:30am on a Saturday morning isn’t a time I would normally be pleased to see. Looking outside didn’t do much to engage my motivation; Aberdeen was wreathed in a dense, Victorian fog and I could barely see the other other side of the street. However, I had somewhere to be and someone to meet so after a few last minute preparations and a pain au chocolat consumed between yawns I was on the road. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mile out of Aberdeen, climbing up to Tyrebagger the fog was left behind and suddenly I was in a world of sunshine and optimism! The fog was dense and low lying and over the next hour or so I would continue to drop down into it only to rise up on the other side. This pattern stopped as I dropped into the valley of the Spey where the cloud was thicker and didn’t seem to be in the mood for going anywhere fast. I rolled into Aviemore behind the bin lorry and pulled up in the empty, fogbound station car park. It felt like November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having slightly overestimated the time it would take me to get to Aviemore I now had half an hour to spare and so I took out my Kindle and read a little, occasionally watching as another sleepy looking passenger arrived at the station. Just a few minutes before the first southbound train of the day was due a taxi screeched to a halt and a flustered lady got out, soon hurrying off to the platform. A few minutes later the Sleeper rolled into the station right on time, a few folk getting off, including my co-conspirator for the weekend. Fresh from several recent trips out in the hills &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlintyRich"&gt;Rich&lt;/a&gt; had travelled up overnight from London for his first taste of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to get a bite of breakfast and finalise route plans over coffee and a bacon roll. However, Aviemore doesn’t seem ready to serve the needs of early hillwalkers and so it was a quick stop at Tesco and then out to park at Whitewell where our sandwiches were complemented by a healthy intake of midges. A quick look at the map confirmed our route choice, taking into account the less than inspiring weather forecast, particularly for Sunday. We would head up to Braeriach via the Lairig Ghru and then make our way along the peaks to the west of the Ghru before camping near the Devil’s Point. Sunday was less certain but we had a few options depending on what the weather brought our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After final preparations (and an apple) we were off, walking through the misty forest towards the start of the Lairig Ghru. Chatting as we walked we were soon on the narrow footpath which climbs up above the chattering Allt Druidh. With the summer forest canopy dark and dense above us it was a bit of time before we noticed the blue skies and sunshine that had appeared. As the trees thinned we could see back down to the forest where the cloud still hung thick and heavy, obscuring any views of Aviemore and Strathspey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delighted with the weather and the fantastic views that were opening out we continued along, climbing up towards the Lairig Ghru. As we neared the narrow, rocky section below the old Sinclair Hut site we paused briefly to chat with a Californian who had enjoyed a brilliant night on the hills. We left the Ghru path and steadily gained height up towards Sron na Lairig the views opening out magnificently. I’ve only ever been up or down this path in clag so it was great to get views of Lurcher’s Crag and across Glen Einich to the distinctively shaped Sgoran Dubh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNWPtu" title="The Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7276/7751179014_c160df0e7a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we headed up the views just got better and better. After the initial steep pull the terrain levelled and we paused to have a drink and take in the stunning views. Apart from the mist hanging on resolutely further down the Spey the skies were gloriously blue and summery, white clouds bubbling up here and there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNWZEu" title="Blue skies of Lurcher's Crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue skies of Lurcher's Crag" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8433/7751213292_d7f7fdcea1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on, crossing Sron na Lairig and then pulling up to the summit ridge. The weather had held and it looked like my third attempt at Braeriach was going to finally bring me a view! I was very excited. Getting to the cliffs far above the Garbh Coire brought with it a “wow” moment. The views suddenly opened out ahead and we were gazing across the deep glen to the towering mass of Carn an t-Sabhail (Cairn Toul) and Sgor an Lochain Uaine (the Angel’s Peak), the green lochan cradled between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNXcYU" title="Glen Dee from Sron na Lairig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Dee from Sron na Lairig" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8428/7751254728_6df9ba28c8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air was almost completely still, the sunshine warm, and we spent a while here relaxing and taking photos. Eventually we got our legs into motion and followed the well trodden path along the edge of the cliffs and up the final gentle slopes to the summit of Braeriach, the UK’s third highest mountain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNXwa7" title="Summit of Braeriach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Braeriach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/7751315872_d5608a699b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views along the cliffs are spectacular and we enjoyed the clear views all around. After visiting the cairn we found a pleasant spot for a late lunch, our feet almost dangling over the cliff-edge. There was a gentle breeze as we munched on some food. The summit got a little busier as a few other folk arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we headed west, following the cliffs as often as we could to reach the Falls of Dhe. Here the infant Dhe, already a quick flowing stream, plunges over the cliffs and into the An Garbh-choire on its way to Braemar and eventually out to the sea at Aberdeen some 70 or 80 miles away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took the opportunity to refill our bottles with deliciously fresh mountain water and then continued on, again tracking the edge of the cliffs somewhere near Einich Cairn. The views were constantly changing, especially as we got closer and closer to Sgor an Lochain Uaine, its scrambly northeast ridge revealed in perfect profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we advanced, the weather began to change. Clouds, darker than earlier, were now rolling in and it looked like the forecast rain shower was on its way. We headed down to the col before the Angel’s Peak, admiring the views out west to the Central Highlands which were picked out by breaks in the cloud allowing glorious shafts of light to strike the landscape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNYo6A" title="Towards the Tarf Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Tarf Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8294/7751483868_d619499726_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In front of us now a towering wall of black cloud had gathered. It looked ominous but there was no feeling of humidity or electric tension in the air so it didn’t seem as though it was a thundery storm. We warily made our way to the summit under these dark skies, arriving at the cairn just as the first smattering of raindrops fell. It was soon on with full waterproofs and then we sat down to see how long it would last. The cloud was moving in very unpredictable ways as the squall passed over us but it seemed that blue sky would have to prevail eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNYyy1" title="Sgor an Lochain Uaine by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgor an Lochain Uaine" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8446/7751519040_0542e0523a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twenty minutes later we were still getting wet. A decision was made to continue on as it seemed that the rain would have to relent. With little actual wind though the shower was very slow moving and the falling water made the ascent of Cairn Toul, a jumble of slippery boulders, a little more interesting. At the summit cairn there were still no views but we took a break for food anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we descended off the south side of Cairn Toul the rain finally eased and within moments of arriving at the col before Point 1213 there were blue skies above. It was a wonderful feeling to take off waterproofs at last! After a pause for more photos we headed up to the cairn at the summit of Point 1213 enjoying views back to Cairn Toul whose summit was now, of course, cloud free! Ahead, and some way below us, was the Devil’s Point with the wide bealach below its bouldery summit slopes. This was to be our resting spot for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After descending the grassy slopes from Point 1213 we quickly found a flattish, dryish area where the tents were pitched. Mine was up up first and then Rich got his Laser Comp up close by. The views were cloudier than they had been earlier in the day and there was an odd spot of rain but the conditions were mostly excellent and soon the slopes of Ben Macdui were lit by a gentle evening sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cNZ8KQ" title="Ben MacDui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben MacDui" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8297/7751630738_593a8317a4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tents up and gear set out to dry we settled down for a spot of dinner accompanied by hot drinks. Stoves were compared, water was boiled and dinner was enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dinner we went for an amble up to the summit of the Devil’s Point, an easy walk from the bealach up boulder slopes and then along the fabulous summit ridge with wide views out over the River Dhe. The gloaming was fast falling and the surrounding mountains stood silhouetted against the last pale light of the day. There wasn’t much colour as the sun sank beyond the cloudbanks in the west and all too briefly a rising full Moon was seen red and ruddy in the east.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fading light we picked our way back to the tent where hot chocolate was enjoyed as the first stars appeared overhead, twinkling in a gap between clouds. A gentle breeze had blown most of the midgies away and we sat around enjoying the final vestiges of the day. After the 4:30am alarm call it was good to finally clamber into bed around 11:30, though only after I hastily evicted a giant spider that was making itself cosy in the corner of my inner! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cPeRtJ" title="Campsite below the Devil's Point by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Campsite below the Devil's Point" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7136/7754502660_66d64b001f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I slept long and peacefully, right through until my alarm went off at 6:30. After a moments confusion I got it silenced and dosed off for another half an hour so. I finally roused myself just after 7 and through the mesh of my inner could quickly ascertain that the day was less than inspiring, our tents surrounded by cloud which was being wafted gently over the bealach. We got up though and soon had breakfast on the go. Hot drinks and a few cereal bars did the job for me whilst there was much amusement as Rich cooked up bacon and potatoes which was fried off in rehydrated fat! After a second cup of tea we got ourselves packed up, the tents saturated from the moist air adding a bit of weight to our packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cPeUdY" title="Organised Tent by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Organised Tent" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8439/7754511896_e34e82befd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the time it took to get breakfast and sort ourselves out for the day the cloud had begun to lift and there was faint inkling of misty hillsides somewhere off in the distance. It also wasn’t raining and buoyed by that fact we decided to give our planned high route a go. Initially this took us on a fabulous high level contour above Glen Geusachan. Far below us the Geusachan Burn flowed swiftly on its way to meet the Dhe whilst the distant roar of waterfalls tumbling down the flanks of Beinn Bhrotain were first heard and then seen as the mist gradually thinned and lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cPeUTC" title="Deer Face Off by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deer Face Off" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8287/7754514138_ceb7519695_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrain was pathless but relatively easy, only an occasional small boulder field to negotiate. The plan was to maintain height around to Loch nan Stuirteag which appeared out of the mist as we neared the head of Glen Geusachan. To get there though we had an interesting traverse. The first obstacle was the Allt Clais an t-Sabhail which comes down a narrow ravine from the col between Cairn Toul and the Angel’s Peak. With all the rain recently this was fast flowing and the rocks were slippery. A place to cross was found and then it was a gravelly scramble up the far bank. The rest of the traverse was no less interesting with several more stream crossings to negotiate, each one separated by strips of slippery, marshy and very steep slopes. It was with some relief we reached the shores of Loch nan Stuirteag where the sun was starting to shine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a breather here, having a drink of water and a couple of snacks before heading off, now ascending beside the inflow of the loch and up onto the Moine Mhor. In these conditions - blue skies with impressive clouds drifting about - it was an amazing place to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed the wide, lazy river, keeping to the high ground just above the marshy flats. A path came and went but mostly we went across country, bearing roughly for the track we could see coming down from the high ground below Carn Ban Mor. The gentler slopes of the yesterday’s pointed peaks provided plenty of visual interest despite their rounded appearance and although I got wet feet, the ground was ok, and we were able to wend our way between the bogs on more or less solid ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing Loch nan Cnapan we climbed up gentle slopes towards the track, getting grand views down the Eidart to the hills beyond the upper waters of the Feshie. Here we paused for a spot of lunch, the views glorious in all directions and no other figure on the landscape. After lunch we decided to forgo the track and instead crossed to the head of Glen Einich for the remarkable views down to the loch. I last stood in a very similar spot back in March on my traverse from Blair Atholl to Aviemore. With clouds adding to the drama of the scene it was a pleasure to revisit this awesome spot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now made our way along the high level track which skirts around the western rim of Glen Einich heading towards the Munro of Sgor Gaoith. This gives spectacular views down to Loch Einich and for the first time on the trip we had a proper wind in our faces. Ahead of us Sgor Gaoith’s prominent summit was visited by several walkers and some of these we greeted as they made their way down. Up on the plateau we paused briefly to admire the views down Speyside towards the hazy hills of the Highlands and then headed up to the now deserted summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braeriach was clinging onto some cloud but gradually came free as we enjoyed the views down to Loch Einich and further back across the Moine Mor and the route we had taken that morning. Looking back over the hills of yesterday there was a remarkable sense of journey which really only comes in the rolling plateau of the Cairngorms. We spent a long time on the summit, sending Tweets, checking Social Hiking, admiring the views and having some more food. We had the place to ourselves and enjoyed just drinking in all the stunning scenery. The weather and light was changing all the time and as we got ready to leave dark clouds had amassed over the high Cairngorms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got our packs sorted and then headed off on the final hill leg of the trip. From Sgor Gaoith we followed the clear track along to Sgoran Dubh Mor and then dropped down the ridge towards Creag Dubh. As we descended a strange part rainbow appeared in the rays of light over Glen Einich. This gradually developed over the course of an hour or so into a full blown double bow arcing across the glen. It was spectacular and many photos were taken. Of course, after the rainbow came the rain and as we headed up to Creag Dubh it started. Though it was light and drizzly at first we still took the opportunity to shelter in the lee of Clach Choutsaich to have some final food before pressing on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the Argyll Stone the rain really started and the rolling summit of Creag Dubh was lost in the clag. Careful navigation got us along the remainder of the ridge until it bent around to drop into Glen Einich. The slopes, at first rather benign, soon turned into a steep and slippery descent which landed us in a fine stretch of bog to be traversed to the track. Luckily the rain only really started as we reached the firm ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cPiiqW" title="Clouds gathering over the Glen Einich hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds gathering over the Glen Einich hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8438/7755175298_ba08a8c12e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a clear way ahead and no incentive to hang around we headed off, making our way back to Whitewell. The rain increased in intensity until it was a full on assault, heavy drops falling near vertically down. The track rapidly turned to a river, large pools developing, and drainage channels fast flowing with muddy, silt-charged water. Our pace was fairly rapid and so we covered the last couple of miles very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the car it was still thrumming down. Plans to change out of wet clothing were abandoned and after only the most basic of post-walk rituals we headed down the road into Aviemore. The roads were as wet as the track had been and the puddles continued to grow. Happily we got down to town ok and then sought shelter in the Cairngorm Hotel where a post walk (half)pint was enjoyed, accompanied by hot soup and a course of steaming Venison stew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it was a case of dropping Rich off back at the train station before heading back to Aberdeen. The weather made the return drive interesting. The torrential rain thankfully stopped a few miles east of Aviemore and by the time I got to Aberlour the roads were dry. I decided to head across the hills but encountered thick fog on the drive to Huntly. It was a relief to get to the A96 and then a quick drive back into Aberdeen getting back in time to jump into bed, happy but exhausted, just before midnight.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="overnight"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="munro"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="braeriach"></category><category term="wildcamping"></category></entry><entry><title>Derry Cairngorm</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/05/derry-cairngorm/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-12T22:28:55+01:00</published><updated>2012-05-12T22:28:55+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-05-12:/blog/2012/05/derry-cairngorm/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 12th May 2012&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the Derry Burn there wasn’t much chance to get back into the swing of walking again before we were climbing up the steep, steep path that winds its way up to Carn Crom and the southern end of the long ridge that climbs up to Derry Cairngorm. The views began to open out almost immediately with the Derry Munros of Ben Bhreac and Ben a’ Chorain whitest of whites against a blue sky dotted with clouds. The line of the Lui Water stretched away to its meeting with the Dee. Luibeg was seen once we had attained the first crest on the hill, its pines dark against the shimmering hillsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now headed towards the distant shape of Derry Cairngorm. The path is clear and easy to follow although there was one interesting stretch where a high snowbank forced us to scramble up a wet, rocky wall poised above Glen Derry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/csveho" title="The head of Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The head of Glen Derry" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7258/7519856274_142353730a_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we regained the plateau we enjoyed fine views across the foothills of Ben Macdui towards Cairn Toul sitting above the Lairig Ghru. We continued following the track towards Derry Cairngorms, with snow patches increasing as we advanced. Soon it was a steep climb up deep snow to reach another subsidiary peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the remarkable views now including the Coire Sputan Dearg side of Ben Macdui, nestling the Lochan Uaine in its arms, we advanced onwards, climbing the final summit slopes to the cairn at the south end of Derry Cairngorm's bouldery summit plateau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a bitterly cold wind but despite this we stood around marvelling at the views that showed us snow-capped mountains all around, contrasted against the greenery of the lowlands. Whilst we waited for everyone to regroup we took the opportunity to hunker down in the lee of the summit and enjoy a spot of lunch, looking out across the central Cairngorms from Cairn Gorm itself out to distant Beinn Rinnes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/csvFrN" title="Lochan Uaine below Ben MacDui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan Uaine below Ben MacDui" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7519944284_52feace318_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit we now continued north, heading down unbroken snow slopes and then climbing up to reach the top of Creagan a'Choire Etchachan before descending its far side to reach the shores of Loch Etchachan. We were surrounded by sublime scenery, including the corniced wall of Coire Sputan Dearg, and a view down towards Glen Derry and our descent route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The going besides the loch was tough going in knee-deep snow and as we headed east a rumbling sound alerted us to an avalanche tearing down the cliffs on the far side of the loch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After wading through the snow we eventually reached the start of the track down to Glen Derry. Thankfully it was largely free from snow but we still had an entertaining descent besides the tumbling burn to reach flatter ground near the Hutchinson Memorial Hut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a short break at the hut we headed down into Glen Dee, following the well maintained track and crossing the main burn and several smaller side streams, all of which were high and fast moving with plenty of snow melt. At the Glas Allt Mor we had to help a few nervous folk over but soon we were on the other side and wending our way through Glen Derry as the afternoon turned to a beautiful evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were soon back amongst the pines and crossing the Derry Burn by another bridge before the final stretch down to Derry Lodge where we took a well deserved break to rest weary feet and have a last bite to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/csDG4S" title="Glen Derry Pine by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Derry Pine" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8006/7521507272_f2d6e96ba7_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we made our way down the Derry Road the clouds, which had been gathering for a couple of hours, now seemed to be conspiring into something more sinister. Thankfully we escaped any rain and by the time we dropped back down through the woods to the Linn of Dee the sun was shining again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the walking done there was time for a refreshing pint or two in the Fife Arms back in Braemar before the journey back east to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Atholl Forest and Western Cairngorms Traverse (Day 3)</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-day-3/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-25T23:35:47+01:00</published><updated>2012-03-25T23:35:47+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-03-25:/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-day-3/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 25th March 2012&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I awoke it was that still, cold hour before dawn. The skies were much hazier, the stars mostly veiled and some patchy cloud was drifting around the glen. I dozed off again, waking some time later when the quality of light had changed and the sun was almost up. Outside it was a beautiful dawn. A crisp, deep blue sky, dewy grass, and the mountains all around me. I made a cup of coffee and sat around, watching the colours change and the sun suddenly crest the eastern hills. It was a stunning sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lower than expected mileage the previous day meant I wanted to get an early start, but the beautiful sunlight and lazy feel to the morning was not conducive to this and it eventually took me almost an hour to get everything sorted and packed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884563822"&gt;&lt;img alt="Airing the tent" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/6884563822_1e30033507_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once away I followed the Feshie to the point at which it is joined by the Eidart coming down from the heights around Monadh Mhor. A Scottish Rights of Way sign points you north to a bridge and I followed the path as it bobbed and weaved above this stunning section of river. This culminated at the Eidart Falls where the river cascades over a big drop into a dramatic pool. Above it is the somewhat rickety bridge which takes you over the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884573446"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking besides the Feshie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7133/6884573446_e1f2f34d0c_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030692517"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Eidart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7076/7030692517_521699672d_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884598516"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waterfall on the Eidart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7039/6884598516_08ddea4171_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other bank there was not much sign of a path (besides the one heading back to the Feshie) and so after briefly trying to follow the river I gave it up for a lost cause and struck out across the bog, hoping to make the shortest distance across to the start of the ridge of Cnapan Eachan which was my chosen route up onto the plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030727801"&gt;&lt;img alt="Footbridge over the Eidart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7030727801_f02a17b986_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end it took longer than expected, including an annoying backtrack to retrieve a dropped hat which I had taken off as the morning rapidly warmed up. Thankfully though the bog did at last end and once I started gaining height I got glorious views into the head of the Eidart whilst the blue skies opened up above me. I climbed the final steep slopes up to the ridge and rejoiced in the feel of short, springy heather beneath my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884660712"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down on the Eidart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7194/6884660712_4b9afb042e_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030767905"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back to the Tarf Hills" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7220/7030767905_a2c55a8ee7_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030777225"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Cairngorms" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7129/7030777225_406b8f716a_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030785843"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Eidart" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7068/7030785843_eeeda9902a_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon joined a vehicle track coming up from the Eidart and followed this up steep, grassy slopes to the rocky top overlooking the river. A bubbling stream provided ample refreshment and the spectacular views to the high Cairngorms, encompassing Beinn Bhrotain, Cairn Toul and around to Braeriach, made all the effort worthwhile. I could have moved straight up to the plateau here but the slight deviations to look down over the Eidart were definitely worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on the going was much easier. Although I’d ascended in my base layer I now put my jacket on as there was a decent breeze blowing across the high ground. I headed west and soon picked up the clear vehicle track that heads across to Mullach Clach a’ Bhlair. There are a couple of cairns on the way but mostly it is high, rolling moorland across which I made good time. As midday struck I arrived at the summit of the trip’s fifth Munro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views were yet again quite hazy but I enjoyed looking back over the Feshie to the previous day’s hills and especially the spectacular view east across the plateau to the highest Cairngorm summits. I sat down at the small cairn and enjoyed a lunch, watching tiny, ant-like figures crawl along the various tracks that criss-cross this area. One of them made it up to the summit and I engaged in conversation with someone for the second (and last) time on the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mullach there are a couple of choices for getting across to Sgor Gaoith, crossing the Great Moss (the Moine Mor). One is slightly longer but sticks to higher ground, whilst the other appears a little more direct but involves slightly more height gain and loss. I ended up doing a slight mix of the two, initially following the track and then contouring around the head of the impressive Coire Gharbhlach before making my way north and west to pick up the track again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884794402"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hazy views to the Central Cairngorms" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7110/6884794402_406ea606c0_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030906301"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mullach Clach a' Bhlair" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7030906301_41d67dbf5d_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing a stream which featured some impressive snow banks and collapsing bridges I climbed the slope and then left the path again to pick my way across mostly dry bog to the head of Glen Einich. Having camped there last October, but with limited views, I was keen to get a better view of this stunning glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7030944311"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Caochan Dubh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7074/7030944311_33657102ef_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the views were spectacular and I sat for a few minutes perched over the cliffs, looking down to the loch far below and across to the massive bulk of Braeriach. The sun shone and the mountains basked in the unseasonable heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7031017835"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking along the western cliffs of Glen Einich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7048/7031017835_caf73bb253_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6884886314"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach above Loch Einich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7060/6884886314_5a48b2c968_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7031000273"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7109/7031000273_2472f4f07c_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then made my way along a narrow path that sticks close to the cliff edges providing great views down to the loch and along to the pointed summit of Sgor Gaoith. There was the occasional collapsing cornice to liven up the footfall. Too soon I was at the final slope to the summit, emerging onto a great tumble of rocks with a cairn purchased precariously on top (at 1,118m this was the high point of the trip).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7031033747"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7218/7031033747_2c674b8ea8_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views down to the loch and across the vast expanse of the Cairngorms were stunning and to the west I now had good, albeit hazy, views out over the Feshie and Spey towards the Monadhliath. I sat on the northern side of the summit, sheltered from a strong wind, and enjoyed another snack, gazing peacefully down to Loch Einich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided (somewhat foolishly, as I think this led to a subsequent hot spot developing on my foot) that if I hurried I could probably make the 16:55 train from Aviemore. It wasn’t to be but I did increase my pace, following the clear track north to the subsidiary top of Sgoran Dubh Mhor which has a large cairn on a craggy summit. Now it was time to lose a lot of height, dropping down on a ridge to the unnamed spot height at 803m. For the Cairngorms this is a spectacular mountain ridge and as soon as I was away from the relatively busy summit of Sgor Gaoith I was again on my own. I jogged along the final slight climb up to Clach Choutsaich and paused on the rocky summit for my last high views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as I approached the Argyle Stone I dropped down to a faint path that soon branched off down towards the first trees that fill the narrow Coire Follais. This is a quiet little route which features a fun path, both steep and slidey, that drops down rapidly besides the Allt Coire Follais. In this sheltered coire the temperature rose dramatically and it was a relief to get into the coolish shade of the forest. The path was overgrown and muddy in places but easy enough to follow. At one point fallen trees meant you diverted to the other bank but it was easy enough using fallen logs. As the gradient eased the flora grew higher but the track continued on. Suddenly though it petered out. I thrashed forward through some undergrowth and drawf pines only to find myself suddenly laughing out loud. Here was the main landrover track running down towards Loch an Eilein…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaching this clear track was a great weight off my shoulders. I knew now that the navigation, though unfamiliar, was unlikely to go too horribly wrong. The afternoon sun was wonderful and I moved on at a more gentle pace, content now to get to Aviemore at whatever time I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track took me north and west and soon I spied through the trees the quiet waters of Loch Gamhna, nestled beneath Ord Ban. I joined the path that circumanavigates Loch an Eilein and headed clockwise, pausing occasionally to admire the beautiful views of this little slice of Highland perfection. I felt strangely out of place though. Here I was, dusty and dishevelled after two nights and more than forty miles, whilst scattered around the track were couples and families out enjoying a relaxing Sunday afternoon. It all felt a bit strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track quietened down as I approached the ruined castle and as I reached the far corner of the loch there was just one guy taking his kayak out of the water. I sat down on the shores and just breathed it all in: the faint smell of springtime; the cool water lapping at the shore; and the dark march of the Northern Corries beyond the pines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7031287421"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch an Eilein" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7031287421_5a1b07fd49_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now briefly had some roadwalking to do, crossing the low hill to a series of crofts and holiday homes. The path is marked as heading off to the left but this appeared to run through someone’s garage so I deviated slightly, eventually doubling back on myself a short way to get back on track. After another short stretch on a good path I emerged at the main road which runs up to the Ski Centre. It was busy with cars heading back down at the end of the day, but at least there is a cycleway and path besides it which I followed all the way along to the River Spey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once across the river it was a right turn and then a short march along the road to the station in Aviemore. By now my feet were weary and the extra effort after Sgor Gaoith had given me a rather unpleasant hotspot. It was therefore a huge relief to sit down on a station bench and finally put my feet up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have too long to wait for a train so contented myself with fish and chips from a nearby establishment. I would have preferred a pint but didn’t think I had the time to wait. This meant of course that the train was delayed! With my feet up and a healthy dose of ultra-fatty calories, the extra twenty minutes were no great matter and soon enough I was leaving Aviemore heading north on a train that pleasingly had a more than healthy proportion of Gaelic speakers. The sun gradually sank beyond the hills as we climbed over the Slochd; a spectacular end to a spectacular day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Inverness I found a quiet watering hole near the station and enjoyed a couple of ice cold lagers whilst reading a bit more of my book and then it was the train ride back to Aberdeen, marred only by the usual weekend drunks heading back from their time in the big city…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst actually doing the walk I didn’t have such a great feel for moving through a landscape. In fact it felt like more of a short series of day trips you might do on a walking holiday or weekend away. But as soon as I was on the train, lights flashing past the window, the bubble of conversation around me, I closed my eyes and immediately started to get a sense of that journey, the distance I had covered, and the experience of being in that wild landscape, far from any major human activity. Looking back now at the photos and writing these words I feel privileged that I got to experience such a landscape in this way, that I stuck to my plan, and that the weather was kind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Atholl Forest and Western Cairngorms Traverse (Day 2)</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-day-2/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-25T23:20:38+01:00</published><updated>2012-03-25T23:20:38+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-03-25:/blog/2012/03/atholl-forest-and-western-cairngorms-traverse-day-2/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 24th March 2012&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The earlier starry skies had disappeared by dawn and I awoke to find a thick fog swirling around the tent.

Amazingly as I sat eating breakfast the conditions dramatically changed; the thick cloud was swept away to reveal all the surrounding mountain peaks standing clear of cloud-covered glens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change in circumstances got me moving and I was soon packed up and ready to move on. My first hill for the day was to be Beinn Dearg, the Munro immediately to my west which is often accessed by the long walk up Glen Bruar from Blair Atholl, or by crossing over from Glen Tilt. I however was already at 850m and so after briefly going over the top of Carn a’ Chiaraidh, below which I had camped, I contoured around on very boggy ground to a point where I could access the southern slopes of Beinn Dearg. The ground was rough, waterlogged and crossed by many infant streams which gave me ample opportunity to refill my water and thoroughly wash my kitchen things. In this area I came across a large number of snow-white hares, careening through the tussocks. The weather was improving with every step and soon a watery sun was lighting up the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6881697720"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Dearg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7098/6881697720_53a8b160c9_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reaching the slopes of Beinn Dearg I joined the baggers path and soon found my way to the top of this 1,008m high Munro which commands superb views in all directions. Although the views were hazy I could see north to the Cairngorms, west over Rannoch towards Glen Coe and south across a wide sweep of the Highlands. The mountains were patch with snow and rose above fog drifting through the lowlands. East of me was my Corbett of the previous day as well as Carn a’ Chlamain and beyond that the long sinuous ridge of the Beinn a’ Ghlo range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was empty, as befits 10am on a Saturday morning, and after a snack, some photos and a sit down I was on my way, now moving northward towards the Tarf. The summit ridge of Beinn Dearg is delightfully springy and soon I was over the northern top and dropping down the slope to Beinn Ghabhar. After taking in the views across to Beinn Bhreac and the winding line of the Tarf I dropped down towards the river, crossing a snow-choked stream and enjoying the supreme sense of remoteness that this area brings. At this point you are about as far from a road as it is possible to get in the UK and I was the only figure in a huge landscape. What a wonderful feeling!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tarf Water was easily crossed and again is another perfect location for wild camping. I however now made my way up the heathery slopes of Beinn Bhreac, initially following a stream but then climbing steep ground to reach the Corbett’s south-west ridge. Here I found firmer footing and was soon at the summit of this 912m Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was approaching midday, lunch was declared and I sat munching on oatcakes, cheese and salami as I admired the hazy views of the Cairngorms across the Feshie, as well as back towards the mountains I had already been over. The earlier cloud in the valleys had by now started to rise into a thick haze with the sun partially veiled by a thin layer of clouds. There was a breeze blowing and overall the conditions were just about perfect for walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7027999179"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn Bhreac" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7027999179_1572468b0a_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6881907912"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ring of Tarf" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7185/6881907912_4ec2a13106_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a half hour or so it was time to be pushing on as the afternoon presented itself with the two Tarf Munros before I would drop down to camp. I had been planning on getting quite close to the Cairngorm plateau and camp somewhere up the River Eidart but had realised that the nature of the terrain was slowing down progress. Instead I now looked out and saw an excellent bit of land next to the Feshie which should provide perfect camping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7028021159"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boggy land on the Ring of Tarf" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/7028021159_f24aa9413b_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7028027279"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Feshie and the Cairngorms" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7269/7028027279_2ce531fe26_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6881950928"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Tarf and Tilt" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6881950928_6abe793b9c_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Beinn Bhreac I rapidly dropped down to the boggy bealach below Cnap a Coire Creagach which I then climbed, bypassing the first top but instead making for Cairn Mail Tionail. I deviated off course slightly to visit this top which commands spectacular views over the watershed separating the Feshie and the Geldie. Then it was an easy rise to the summit of Carn an Fhidhleir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7028058875"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing towards Carn an Fhidhleir" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7091/7028058875_6011128b75_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again an empty summit presented itself. With the sun having burnt off most of the high cloud the light green moss around the cairn was brightly lit and I enjoyed the hazy views off in all directions. The hills of the morning now looked pleasingly distant, whilst the Cairngorms were looming a little larger. As I sat trying to get signal to send a text the first person since Blair Atholl hoved into view. He had camped at Geldie Lodge the previous night and had already been up An Sgorsoach. We had a pleasant chat and it was suggested our paths might cross as he returned to his tent, whilst I made for the Feshie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6882013138"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Cairngorms" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7251/6882013138_1347dfb432_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this pleasant encounter I once again shouldered my pack and now made my way eastward, following the easy going track that gently drops of the summit of Carn an Fhidhleir. It then traverses steep slopes to avoid the subsidiary top . These slopes were a bit treacherous with remaining snow banks covering the path. I climbed up over one of these and then made directly for the bealach to avoid any further trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6882029150"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow patch and path on Carn an Fhidhleir" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/6882029150_516db7af5d_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another delightful stretch of bog was soon crossed and then it was a steep pull up the western slopes of An Sgarsach. Behind me the bog ran off down to the Tarf with familiar hills running off into the hazy distance. As I climbed higher I eventually picked up a path that sped up progress and I was soon standing on the summit of this 1,006m high Munro. The hazy views were similar to Carn an Fhidhleir but the cairn is more substantial and again I stopped for sustenance and an opportunity to send and receive messages. The sun was slowly creeping into the western part of the sky and the land was bathed in hazy golden sunlight. I now knew I wasn’t going to make it to the Cairngorm plateau before dark and so set my sights on the big bend in the Feshie where the river turns from an eastward course to a westward course separated from the Geldie by just a short stretch of undulating plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6882083460"&gt;&lt;img alt="South from An Sgarsoch" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/6882083460_0c51584638_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent was initially straightforward until the ground levelled off and then I was back amongst tussock and bog. After a few photos of the mighty Cairngorms I crossed the Allt a’ Chaorainn and then waded through bog and small streams (including the very headwaters of the Geldie) to finally reach the dramatically wide Feshie. With little recent rain the water levels were low, rocky banks and beaches exposed. There was however clear evidence of high flows with debris strewn along the banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a faint path and followed it along the east bank of the river, trying to find a good compromise between sunset and sunrise views as well as good access to the river for water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6882174658"&gt;&lt;img alt="An Sgarsoch" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/6882174658_31310afab1_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I found my spot and encouraged by the setting sun soon had the tent up. My camp site was perfect, with views back to An Sgarsach, as well as to the long line of corries that eat into the south of the high Cairngorm plateau. The river quietly babbled away to the west and was soon stocked up with plenty of cool water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7028339239"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pitched besides the Feshie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7107/7028339239_767d00c1f2_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little breeze was blowing, just enough to set a chill, but sitting in the lea of the tent, a cuppa in hand, I watched with a feeling of great peace and tranquillity, the gradual setting of the sun beyond the western hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6882286638"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tarptent Scarp 1" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/6882286638_14fcb46a85_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a very relaxed evening. The moon, Venus and Jupiter put on an excellent twilight show, and then I enjoyed a superb dinner of beef and ale stew. Although the breeze had disappeared along with the sun, the clear skies meant it got very cold, very quickly. Dinner was had inside the tent, but then I got out again for more stargazing and photos. Later I retired back to my warm sleeping bag, reading a few chapters before changing my watch to account for the “spring” forward and soon thereafter drifting off into a satisfied sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke at some point in the night and poked my head out to find another wonderfully starry sky. My socks were partially frozen but I went out anyway to play briefly with the camera again before the cold sent me back to my down cocoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a week of glorious sunshine in Aberdeen I pulled back the curtains to find it was a grey Friday morning. I guess this is what happens when you book a day off work in order to head to the hills! Thankfully by the time I was heading down to the station, the heavier camping pack on my back, the sun was out and it was a glorious morning; an auspicious start. Train ticket purchased I was soon sitting on the relatively quiet 09:34 service to Glasgow Queen Street. Initially the weather and views were glorious, the sun shimmering off the North Sea, and the fields freshly ploughed and ready to show spring shoots. However, from around Arbroath the cloud built up and it was grey and a little gloomy by the time I got off the train at Perth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After purchasing some lunch I had a half hour or so wait for my connection, joining the Highland Main Line and a train that felt distinctly touristier. Forty minutes later I was one of only two passengers who alighted at Blair Atholl. The other guy had a huge pack on, and after sitting reading the paper for a few minutes, he set off towards the village. I meanwhile crossed the tracks and then spent a couple of minutes sorting my pack, taking a ceremonial starting picture (of Blair Atholl station), and then headed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6875457424"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blair Atholl Station" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/6875457424_e65fc5771b_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was with a mixture of excitement, relief and trepidation that I started the walk. A strange feeling to think I was now out here and on my own, with almost three full days of walking ahead. There was really nothing left to get on with it though and so I quickly threaded my way along the Atholl estate roads to the Old Bridge of Tilt, spotting a couple of eagles wheeling over the fields. From the car park I started to pick up smaller footpaths which take you on a dramatic route above the tumbling gorge of the lower Tilt river. Eventually I was deposited back on a vehicle track and then the walking was very easy and pleasant for a while. The woods were still a little drab but birds were singing and the first signs of a green spring could be seen slowly emerging. Around a corner in the track (and after avoiding the Post Office truck) I got my first view of the bigger hills rising above the upper reaches of the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021610623"&gt;&lt;img alt="Woods in Glen Tilt" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7102/7021610623_be5f4ff97f_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After successfully crossing the silent rifle range I dropped down to the river near Gilbert’s Bridge and followed the river bank for a while, pausing briefly at the bend near Auchgobhal to take in the view up to the southern flanks of Carn a’ Chlamain, and further east the bulk of Beinn a’ Ghlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6875550546"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds over Glen Tilt" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7052/6875550546_b4675d5f9a_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the narrow stone bridge that spans the Allt Mhairc I took a brief detour up to a ruined shieling with great views out over Glen Tilt. You could continue on the track here to get straight up on to the Corbett where I was to camp that night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021660215"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Beinn a' Ghlo" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7108/7021660215_3c47e394c2_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a Munro to bag though so continued further on up the Tilt, passing Marble Lodge and then starting to climb up after the bridge over the Allt Crominidh. A footpath quickly ascends the steep hillside, the views rapidly opening up, until it joins with the vehicle track that comes up from Clachglas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021721883"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Tilt" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7184/7021721883_f276ab2d68_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This long spur is then followed all the way up to the summit of Carn a’ Chlamain. As I climbed, the views of the mountain became more dramatic and occasionally footpaths could be used to cut out corners in the winding vehicle track. I came across marshy areas where frogs were in the process of creating frogspawn, and eventually found a bubbling spring where I refilled my bottle with deliciously clear and cold water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021759161"&gt;&lt;img alt="Brooding clouds over Carn a' Chlamain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7111/7021759161_0fbeefc170_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views around me were hazy and it looked like a band of showers were passing the hills nearer Loch Tay. Briefly the summits of Beinn a’ Ghlo were shrouded in thin cloud. It was perfect walking weather though with just enough of a breeze to keep me cool and fabulous views of the surrounding hills. The grey, scree slopes of the summit cone of Carn a’ Chlamain now presented themselves, along with a strong and blustery wind. In no time I was up on the summit; my first new Munro since November 2011 and the first time above the magic 3,000 feet since New Year. It was a great feeling, especially as I had the hills completely to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stony summit was very cold and blowy so after taking in the views I hunkered down behind the cairn to send some text messages and eat a few snacks. It was now around four-thirty and my aim was to be pitching the tent by five-thirty. I could see my intended pitch in the distance but there was still some way to go so I started moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6875823084"&gt;&lt;img alt="South towards Blair Atholl from Carn a' Chlamain" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6228/6875823084_4e33e3a6bc_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it was an easy crossing of the mossy plateau west of the Munro summit to reach the top of Aonach na Cloiche Moire, and then a steep descent into the glen containing the winding Feith an Lochain which drops down from the lonely Loch Mairg. With springy grass and running water I was almost tempted to stop here but the thought of a high camp drew me forward. The two hundred metres or so of re-ascent weren’t bad in the end, and although I had filled my water reservoir up in the glen, I came across a clear stream running down from the bealach where I filled up again. This area was alive with yet more frisky frogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7021988567"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Beinn Dearg" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6107/7021988567_50bd7a8dbb_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I came out onto the plateau I spied a grouping of rocks below the final rise to Carn a' Chiaraidh, the northern top of Beinn Mheadhonach, and it was here I found an excellent, flat shelf to camp on, the ground springy with moss. The wind had died down by now which made getting the tent up hassle free and soon I had everything sorted. The decision to stop with daylight still was good and before settling in for dinner I decided to go and bag the summit of the Corbett.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the map this lay just south of me, probably a kilometre or so away and with barely 30 metres of ascent to worry about. The twilight was creeping up and the sky had clouded over quite thickly so it was quite gloomy as I made my way up. I was soon at the summit but then looking south there was a second top that looked slightly higher. I continued on to this one, only to find yet another further top that again seemed higher. By this time the faint pink of sunset which had briefly appeared over Beinn Dearg had faded from the sky and I was left in the misty gloaming. The third top proved to be the final one with the mountain dropping off quickly towards Glen Tilt. I took a few photos and then made my way back to the tent. I think the fading light had emphasised the illusion of height as the OS clearly mark the very first top as the spot height!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then time for a supper of &lt;a href="https://www.fuizionfreezedriedfood.com/productitem.aspx?prodid=5c3d4675-fa06-4fb7-bec5-66710f5cd8fe"&gt;lamb stew and pearl barley&lt;/a&gt; (a favourite of mine), eaten on a crag looking out on a misty world. The thick cloud allowed a few breaks and at one point I glimpsed Venus before it all closed in again. I retired to the tent to read for a while (&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lustrum-Robert-Harris/dp/0091801001"&gt;Lustrum by Robert Harris&lt;/a&gt;, recently downloaded to my Kindle). When I poked my head out again a couple of hours later night had fallen and, amazingly, the sky had largely cleared to reveal a stunning star filled cosmic dome. I spent a long time star gazing, taking a few photos and preparing for the night before eventually snuggling down into my cosy sleeping bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7022083969"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cooking with gas" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6239/7022083969_de06d19261_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one Munro and one Corbett climbed, it had been a great start to the traverse and now I was ready for the big push across the Atholl Forest and Tarf hills.&lt;/p&gt;

There is however one area that still isn’t fixed properly in my mind yet. It is a blank space in my mind’s map; and that is the hills around Glen Gairn. The River Gairn rises on the southern slopes of Ben Avon and eventually meets the River Dee at Ballater making it the longest tributary of that river.  With the direct link to Deeside it was once a well populated glen with pastures and homesteads scattered along its length. Nowadays the shielings are ruins, the glen is silent and I was fascinated by this wild area so close to the populace villages of Deeside. Although the trip I ended up doing didn’t take me all the way along the Gairn (something I still plan to do) I visited its central section and enjoyed my night spent there gazing at the distant stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday 25th February – Corgarff castle to River Gairn wild camp&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday dawned bright and chilly in Aberdeen. Though the preceding few days had been mild to the point where I had dropped down to just a windshirt for the walk to work, the weekend forecast was a little less promising. In particular MWIS was predicting very strong winds (gusts to 80mph) for Sunday afternoon. With this in mind I came up with a plan that gave me an opportunity to head up onto the plateau of Ben Avon, most eastern of the big Cairngorm hills, on Sunday morning in the hope of catching a break in the weather. To get there I would camp in Glen Gairn, to the south of a winding route that takes you up onto the plateau. Another consideration was the sky show promised for Saturday evening with the Moon, Venus and Jupiter all in close proximity in the west after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having now been walking in the Cairngorms and surrounding hills for a few years I’m starting to better put together my internal map of how the glens and hills of the region fit together. There is however one area that still isn’t fixed properly in my mind yet. It is a blank space in my mind’s map; and that is the hills around Glen Gairn. The River Gairn rises on the southern slopes of Ben Avon and eventually meets the River Dee at Ballater making it the longest tributary of that river.  With the direct link to Deeside it was once a well populated glen with pastures and homesteads scattered along its length. Nowadays the shielings are ruins, the glen is silent and I was fascinated by this wild area so close to the populace villages of Deeside. Although the trip I ended up doing didn’t take me all the way along the Gairn (something I still plan to do) I visited its central section and enjoyed my night spent there gazing at the distant stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant drive out through Alford and Strathdon I pulled up at the car park for Corgarff castle just on eleven in the morning. The bright weather had remained with me and I booted up under blue skies. There was a breeze but down in the valley it was pleasant though I decided to take my winter jacket with me rather than the Vapour Rise. A couple of walkers who had overtaken me on the road near Strathdon were off up in the distance and I followed them, skirting past the castle and dropping down to pick up a vehicle track which winds up on the west bank of the Cock Burn. I soon passed the couple (how come people who drive so quickly, walk so slowly?) as the path turned to reach the boggy bealach between Carn Oighreag and Brown Cow Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind me the views opened out across the winding line of the Don to the hills that lie to the west of the Lecht road. Occasionally I disturbed a grouse which would careen off across the heather, chuckling away to itself. As I climbed higher thankfully the thick heather become shorter and springier and I started to pick up my pace. That was of course until I reached the peat hags which guard the eastern end of Brown Cow Hill. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hags were somewhat tortuous to navigate, as all such things are, but eventually I wended and bobbed my way through them, climbing the final short way to the eastern end of the heathery plateau. The OS mark this tiny cairn as Brown Cow Hill but it is clear that the next lump along is the high point of the hill and so I made for this. The wind up here was brisk and I was soon wrapped up in my buff and hood. The going though was largely good with only a short section of springy moss and bog and soon enough I was on the summit of this lumpy Corbett for a grand height of 829m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the clear light of early afternoon the expansive views were fantastic. Ahead of me Ben Avon and its tors caught my eye, snow clinging on in large patches. To the south Lochnagar was shrouded in dark, stormy looking clouds. East the distinctive shape of Morven could be seen above the smaller hills that surround it with the Hill of Fare, near Aberdeen, a long green line to its south. To the north Carn Ealasaid stood at the end of the long, sinuous ridge that was to become my target for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6936554533"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rain showers over Upper Deeside" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7048/6936554533_21bfbe0f82_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused here for some lunch, munching on oatcakes, cheese and salami whilst watching the light change over the Deeside Hills. The wind was certainly blustery and there isn’t a great deal of shelter on Brown Cow Hill. Smoke billowed up from some burning heather towards Crathie and heavier showers were passing in front of the Glenshee hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit I continued heading west, crossing the final lumpy summit at the west end of Brown Cow Hill before dropping a short way to the bealach and then climbing up to the rocky top of Meikle Gael Charn. Here the showers which had been bothering other hills finally caught up with me. Luckily I did get a few fleeting views down Glen Gairn and Loch Builg and across to Ben Avon before I tucked the camera away into a waterproof bag and started to drop down to the loch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground is rough and uneven but the slope gentle enough and only a light rain was falling. Beyond it a watery sun shone through the clouds and so once I was down at the loch I stopped off to have a breather besides its peaty water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6790597896"&gt;&lt;img alt="Winter sunshine on Loch Builg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7061/6790597896_841b0e5baa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now all I had to do was push on to where I wanted to camp for the night, further west along Glen Gairn. I followed the path along to the end of the loch and then joined a series of landrover tracks which circumenvented the marshier ground near the smaller lochans and pools. Eventually I picked up the stalkers path which climbs up above Glen Gairn and followed this, getting my first close up view of the River Gairn itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939137557"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of the many lochans" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7196/6939137557_c57d0c0e48_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glen is wide and relatively fertile, strips of tussocky grass separated by wide swathes of heather. The stalker’s path is excellent and I made good progress despite the more persistent rain. Eventually it let up and I started to dry out. This process was speeded up once I turned a corner of the glen and came into the face of a strong westerly wind. It didn’t seem too bad so I continued on, making for a spot where I would be in a good position to climb Ben Avon the next day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached the narrowing in the glen I saw a good sward of grass and went over to investigate. It was good: flat, grassy and close to the river. Unfortunately it was not to be. I spent a good while trying to get the tent up but each time it was almost erect a ferocious gust would blow through the valley and tear all the anchors out. I struggled to keep hold of the tent as it billowed sail-like in the wind. The tent was buckling, even with crossover poles on and it seemed that the wind was strengthening as evening approached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939209803"&gt;&lt;img alt="Big skies over Ben Avon" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7051/6939209803_741b08883e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I saw sense and packed everything back up, returned to the path and backtracked about a kilometre or so to a point where the river bent closer to the track and came into the shelter of a small shoulder of hillside. It was just enough to deflect the wind and although there was a breeze it was much, much better than the first site. I dropped to the river and though the ground was a bit boggier I found a Scarp sized area of dry ground. The tent went up easily this time though and soon I had everything unpacked and sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gathering twilight I set to brewing some water for a meal and drink. I had brought along my Caldera Cone but in hindsight meths was perhaps a poor choice for this trip. The breeze made it difficult to light and the low water temperature (a lot of snow melt I’m guessing) meant it took a long time and quite a bit of fuel to boil sufficient water for food and drink.  Eventually though and with darkness falling I got into my tent and enjoyed rehydrated fish and potatoes (my finally pack from Expedition Foods) followed by a caramel latte and some dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although dusk had come with increasing cloud, by around 8pm the sky was much clearer. I had been reading in my tent but now with the stars out, I got out to have a look around. In fact, the sky was incredible. In the cloudy west there was a hazy view of the moon and Venus, whilst to the south Orion strode across the sky, the stars blazing white and orangey red. Throughout the evening I kept on reading but with half an eye on the tent door, watching the stately progress of the stars. By half past ten the Moon had set, leaving a beautifully dark sky. Thousands of stars lit the cosmic dome and the Milky Way arced directly above me. I dragged out my mat and sleeping bag and lay, cosy and warm, looking up into the wonders of the northern sky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>A Wild Camp in Glen Gairn (Part 2)</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/02/a-wild-camp-in-glen-gairn-part-2/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-02-26T22:18:15+00:00</published><updated>2012-02-26T22:18:15+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-02-26:/blog/2012/02/a-wild-camp-in-glen-gairn-part-2/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday 26th February – River Gairn wild camp to Corgarff castle&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clear skies continued into the morning which unfortunately somewhat muted the sunrise. By the time I got up at around 8am the sky was blue but a dense fog was clinging to all the surrounding summits. In particular I could see that Ben Avon was shrouded in it above about 800m.  There was a chill to the air and it would be a bit longer before the sun broke through to my camping spot so I warmed up by getting all my gear sorted and packed up. The tent fly was drenched with dew but there was no sign of ice or even frost: a very mild night for February in the Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939467863"&gt;&lt;img alt="A Scarp in the landscape" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7186/6939467863_a5ba85f4b4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refilled my water bottle from the river, dropped in a hydration tablet and then headed off. The dense hillfog had put me off making the ascent of Ben Avon so instead I followed my outward track from the day before, heading back through a sleepy Glen Gairn towards Loch Builg. It was delightful once the sun broke above the southern hills and I soon was back down to just baselayer and unzipped jacket. I munched on a cereal bar as I ambled along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939482487"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Carn Liath" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7059/6939482487_2d945ca71a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I approached Loch Builg I took a shortcut across boggy ground to cut out a loop of the vehicle track. I had planned to stop and have a proper breakfast at the Lodge but there was a hint of rain coming off the hills now so instead I pressed on, following the track along the loch edge until I reached the point where I had joined it the previous evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939487265"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning in Glen Gairn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7183/6939487265_70032f06d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now new territory and with rainbows dancing across the loch I dropped down through narrow Glen Builg until I emerged into the wider part of the glen close to the grand house at Inchrory and the meeting with the Avon which comes along from the northern side of the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939537887"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Builg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7179/6939537887_cb5631db36_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I stopped to have brunch, using my stove to heat water for coffee and eating some more provisions. Again, taking water from the cold stream meant it was quite a wait for my brew but I was in no rush and chilled out beside the river for a good twenty-five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939576171"&gt;&lt;img alt="End of Glen Builg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7209/6939576171_7272311c8b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The energy and caffeine boost proved quite restorative and with the sun shining down I headed along, passing Inchrory where I had a brief chat with three chaps on mountain bikes who were heading up the Avon to have lunch at Findoran bothy. I bid them good speed, passed through the gates and was soon ascending the track above the house, now on the track which would take me back to the car at Corgarff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939617705"&gt;&lt;img alt="The house at Inchrory" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7194/6939617705_7de730cf0a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a point on the hillside I made my final decision of the trip: with good weather I turned aside and rather than following the easy track back to the car, I took to the heathery hillside intent on following the broad line of tops around to Carn Ealasaid which I had seen from Brown Cow Hill the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6793532798"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Avon meets the Builg" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7191/6793532798_7eeeb0d872_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939659199"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern corries of Ben Avon" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7069/6939659199_654c94439e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tough first ascent through thick heather but once I came out onto the rolling ridge it was better. A new fence took something away from the big views and sadly the terrain remained quite waterlogged, but the views all around were excellent. Behind me I could now see just how cloud-covered Ben Avon was – the cloud spilling into its northern corries. Further back a constant stream of showers seemed to be moving down Glen Gairn, validating my early start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first top the ridge turned and I dropped quickly down to a col. Here I had to cross the fence and it was only now I found out it was electrified. Luckily they have at least provided proper crossing points. Once at the other side I made quick progress up to the trig point on the summit of Craig Veann.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6793573914"&gt;&lt;img alt="The long march to Craig Veann" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7206/6793573914_df408c59ec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a breather here as the uphill had been a tough stretch, drank some water and ate some chocolate. I now had a view along the ridge across the intermediary top of Tolm Buirich to the summit Carn Ealasaid, starting to look a little closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6793602668"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trig point on Creag Veann" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7193/6793602668_7d751a0824_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were more peat hags to be negotiated but after stopping briefly at Tolm Buirich to admire the view north to Ben Rinnes and across to Gael Charn (which I had been up in November) I was on the final, firmer stretch up to the summit of Carn Ealasaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6793625580"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Rinnes" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7177/6793625580_b8f9f3a6fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing another fence (this time low and unelectrified) I picked up a faint path which took me upwards and quite suddenly I was on the broad summit plateau. The small cairn marking the summit was very close by, set just off a vehicle track. I gratefully slung down my pack and had a sit down. The wind was starting to get quite fierce but I managed to have some lunch, take a few snaps and send off a text to my girlfriend before I headed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6939757405"&gt;&lt;img alt="Electric fence" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7202/6939757405_c01787ba80_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Descending from Carn Ealasaid is a simply matter of following the vehicle track. At times faint paths cut off wide loops and in good time the castle of Corgarff and my car came into view. Unfortunately the river Don doesn’t have any bridge crossings until the main road so after descending past the mysterious cairns and picking up another track near the cottages at xx I strode on down to the main road at the Allargue Arms. I was strongly tempted to pop in for a pint but the car was close by and I wanted to get home so I marched on, down the road and then back along the river a short way to reach the parking spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in it had been a great trip. I was a little disappointed not to have got up on to the plateau of Ben Avon or to have explored some more of its tors (I was last up there in &lt;a href="http://www.invertedworld.co.uk/blog/2008/05/ben-avon-ben-aan/"&gt;May 2008&lt;/a&gt;), but the views of low cloud on Sunday validated my choice and the second Corbett - including a less visited ridge - made up for it. Besides the problems pitching the tent and then heating snow-melted stream water everything went smoothly and I am especially pleased to have got my three season gear out in February! Now the first trip of the year is done I’m going to move towards more ambitious routes with the aim of doing my first multi-night trip in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>Down and out on Gael Charn</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/11/down-and-out-on-gael-charn/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-13T17:15:23+00:00</published><updated>2011-11-13T17:15:23+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-11-13:/blog/2011/11/down-and-out-on-gael-charn/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 13th November 2011&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside it was dark and drizzly, Aberdeen shrouded in a clinging fog. The pavements were slick with rain and the traffic lights danced eagerly through their cycle despite the lack of an audience. The coach was thankfully warm and I got the back seat where with my iPod on I could catch up on some much needed sleep on the long crossing to Tomintoul. When I woke some time later it was light outside and the skies were looking much better. We had left the Aberdeen mist behind and bands of blue sky appeared as we rolled through the foothills of the Cairngorms, turning off the Nethy Bridge road and pulling up at the turning area near Dorback Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once off we took a slightly meandering route to get onto the main track which leads to Gael Charn, a long humpback of a Corbett just north of the main Cairngorm range. If you want to do a better job of reaching the track then do the following: from the turning area take the grassy track which runs up alongside the fence, ford the stream and then pick up the distinct vehicle track between the buildings at Upper Dell. Rather than doing this, we headed past Dorback Lodge and its yappy dogs, followed the track across to Upper Dell (fording the river) and then turned left onto a track which was at first distinct but gradually petered out as it followed the south bank of the Allt Mor. Spotting the track we should have been on away across a bog we crossed the tussocky marshland to eventually join the proper route!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6344403169"&gt;&lt;img alt="Remembrance Sunday" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6217/6344403169_a6475b9824_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We carried on, following the track, passing more estate buildings, and crossing another smaller burn which had gouged a wide, deep channel out of the side of the glen. At 11am we paused to observe the two minutes of silence, remembering those who had given their lives in global conflicts. The quiet, windswept glen with panoramic views towards the Monadh Liath, their upper reaches illuminated by a pale alpenglow, was a good spot for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6351822250"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Allt Mor bog and Cromdale Hills" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6047/6351822250_b105345b88_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6351084053"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over the Cromdale Hills" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6047/6351084053_8f76ec818d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further up we left the track, crossed another burn and then slogged up the steep north-west ridge of Gael Charn. The ridge further to the south would probably have been preferable but never mind, today was a day for going slightly wrong and ploughing on regardless. Once up the steepest part a track of sorts emerged and this was followed up to the misty plateau. Although there had been sunshine in the glen below us, a thick cloud had blown in from the south and the cairn was barely visible through the gloom. We sat here waiting for people to regroup, putting on every layer of insulation in our packs and munching our way through sandwiches and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6351833776"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ascent of Gael Charn" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6217/6351833776_ed04f53744_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6351133553"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Gael Charn" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6237/6351133553_5d99c6683a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once regrouped we followed the plateau southeast towards Gael Charn Beag. As we dropped the twenty metres or so of height from the summit we came out of the cloud again and enjoyed sweeping views across the rough and marshy land north of the Avon, to the long dark march of the northern Cairngorms, all of which were draped in thick clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6351241985"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gael Charn plateau" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6039/6351241985_e17618b569_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made good progress along to Gael Charn Beag and then started to descend towards the Water of Ailnack and the infamous Castle. The views of the cloud swirling about the summits of the Cairngorms, and filling in the passes were quite superb. In the lee of the hill, under bright skies and sat amongst the heather, we enjoyed another brew and a late lunch whilst everyone once again regrouped. We then tentatively walked to the edge to have a look down into the dramatic gorge that contains the Water of Ailnack. The Castle is visible only from below so we didn’t see it on this occasion but this area looks excellent for a prolonged wander and I quite fancy trying to camp down where the various waters meet just upstream of the Castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After admiring the rugged scenery we turned north, following the line of the river but keeping up and away from the crumbling chasm. The going was pathless and sometimes boggy with side streams causing lots of up and downs. The going was fairly slow but in the late sunshine and with  just the bare hint of a breeze it was very pleasant. Ahead Ben Rinnes broke out of cloud whilst to the east the Ladder Hills failed to shake off their own covering. Behind us the tors on Ben Avon gradually silhouetted against the fading sunlight and then with a final bright autumnal glow, it set behind the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lights of Tomintoul winked at us as we made the final gentle descent through the gloomy pine trees to another group of yappy dogs at Delnabo Lodge. It was then past the Highland coos, across the Avon and along quiet country lanes until we reached the village itself. The coach hadn’t shown up at the appointed hour but without too much concern we headed for the Glen Avon Hotel where bottles of Cairngorm Brewery’s finest ales were ordered (only Best on tap, sadly) and we sat down to await the stragglers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time everyone had arrived, there was still no sign of the coach. A few telephone calls were made and it transpired that on the way round from Dorback to Tomintoul the coach had broken down, leaving the driver stranded at the Bridge of Brown. He soon turned up, given a lift by a passing car, and once our bags were rescued everyone was able to order dinner and another pint whilst we waited for a second coach to come through from Aberdeen. This unexpected Sunday evening in the pub was very pleasant and in the end only added a few hours onto our day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 1st - 2nd October 2011&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 32.77km (Day 1: 10.86km; Day 2: 21.91km)&lt;br&gt;
Ascent:  1,384m (Day 1: 238m; Day 2: 1,144m)&lt;br&gt;
Time: 22hrs 29mins (Day 1: 2hrs 2mins; Day 2: 4hrs 25mins)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Stob Coire an Lochain (Munro Top, 1,239m), Braeriach (Munro, 1,296m)&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Rain on and off for the duration. Low cloud, mist, mild temperatures and no wind.&lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/350"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I backed the car into the almost empty parking area at Whitewell and turned the engine off. Steam rose gently from the grill, a sign that the last puddle I’d driven through had been a little deeper than expected. The rain, which had been steady but mainly drizzly on the drive over from Aberdeen, now increased in intensity significantly. Without the windscreen wipers on my windscreen quickly turned into a waterfall, obscuring my view of the world outside. I wasn’t quite prepared for that sort of drenching so it was Jaffa Cakes and a few chapters of &lt;em&gt;The Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; with the hope that the rain would at the very least ease off slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

Without the windscreen wipers on my windscreen quickly turned into a waterfall, obscuring my view of the world outside. I wasn’t quite prepared for that sort of drenching so it was Jaffa Cakes and a few chapters of &lt;em&gt;The Clash of Kings&lt;/em&gt; with the hope that the rain would at the very least ease off slightly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Forty minutes later and not a great deal had changed outside the car. Desperate not to turn tail and return home I checked out the map and gave serious consideration to walking (running) over to the Cairngorm Club Footbridge and camping there for the night. Thankfully, a few minutes later the rain finally slackened off. I gratefully escaped the muggy confines of the car, shouldered my pack and quickly set off before it could worsen again and make me think better of the decision to head down Glen Einich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6206336275"&gt;&lt;img alt="Directions" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6139/6206336275_753f33d8f2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6214426747"&gt;&lt;img alt="Churning Water" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6119/6214426747_9f9547546a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was water everywhere: falling from sodden leaves, falling from the sky, running down the hillsides and running down paths. It was all navigable, but not without getting wet feet. As I strode on the rain slackened off until I was finally able to take down my hood and enjoy the sights and sounds of the damp and dripping forest of Rothiemurchas. The hill tops were slowly shirking off their cloudy wrappings and birds were flitting from branch to branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6214414093"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wandering through Glen Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6221/6214414093_17917c51d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next obstacle came in the form of a posted notice from the Rothiemurchas Estate informing me of the ongoing deer cull (through to the 20th October) and the need for me to stick with the established hill track on the east side of Loch Einich. My original plan had been to take Ross’s Path on the west side of the glen and so attain the plateau somewhere south of Sgor Gaoith. This information changed the plan slightly, making it much more weather dependent as the idea of traipsing around the boggy plateau of Moine Mhor did not appeal if the mist was down. That would be for tomorrow though as the stalking information meant I would be camping at the north end of Loch Einich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6209027562"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6141/6209027562_0c625be540_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wound my way along the path that heads south along Glen Einich. It's easy terrain with the landscape getting wilder as the last of the trees is left behind. A foolish moment of map reading left me wading ankle deep through a stream that had staged a successful coup over the path. I passed a tent pitched beneath a copse of trees and wondered whether I should be thinking of stopping short of the loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204677366"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach and River Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6146/6204677366_53c6856dec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I came to my next obstacle. With the dramatic north-western corries of Braeriach (amazingly cloud free) crouched low over the churning Allt Bandaidh, I came to a small side burn that had swollen to a minor torrent. The water was chocolaty brown, flecked by white waves. I tentatively stuck my pole in and whoosh, it was almost yanked out of my hand as the current caught it. I never even found how deep this particular stream was. Too wide to jump I decided to scout upstream to find a crossing place. Eventually I was successful but I then had a very steep ascent and descent over a hill to regain the track in time to cross the main river and continue on the east bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6209044398"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge over the Am Beanaidh" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6192/6209044398_c5cdcd7c13_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain had eased off and the cloud continued to clear, particularly from the tops which could be seen standing out starkly against the grey sky. Particularly impressive was the western wall of Glen Einich with the sharp peak of Sgor Gaoith now clearly visible. Occasionally mist and cloud blown down the valley would wreath me in fog, but by the time I reached the shores of the loch all was clear again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6209053922"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sgoran Dubh Mhor" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/6209053922_1d56eb7008_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6214435481"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Loch EInich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6037/6214435481_533313dc7c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t spend too much time hunting for a pitch, soon deciding to make use of the grassy area close to the outflow of the loch. It was flat and only a little stony. The speed of tent pitching was increased by the presence of the midgies. The loch surface was a perfect mirror signalling the lack of wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6212397418"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping besides Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6223/6212397418_f06eb57539_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully a while later, once the tent was up and I had my things spread out to dry, a little breeze did get up, enough to ruffle the surface of the water. It drove off the midgies long enough to heat up some water on my stove for a dinner of Thai Chicken Curry and Rice (another excellent meal from Fuizion Freeze Dried Foods).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204609444"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6010/6204609444_a07e30fa81_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6215022500"&gt;&lt;img alt="Caldera Cone" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6112/6215022500_46fcc10367_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was making dinner I suddenly realised that the hillside above me, in fact the whole western lip of Braeriach, was ablaze with sunshine. Somewhere to the west the setting sun had finally sunk below the cloudbase and was illuminating the landscape with remarkable clarity. It was an incredible moment, and one that almost made me wish I had been out earlier to get higher up for the views which, just at that time, must have been incredible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6215005052"&gt;&lt;img alt="Last light on Braeriach" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6215005052_9798b58d21_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204314229"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset somewhere" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6165/6204314229_c4d668e42d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, as the mist drifting through Glen Einich turned a subtle and beautiful shade of pink, the light show was over and the gloaming settled over the glen. Mist now drifted in to cover the loch, bringing with it a splendid silence. As darkness fell I retired to the warmth of the tent and read a few chapters on my Kindle. By the time I was ready for sleep the night was a deep black, mist filled the glen and there sadly wasn’t a star to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked outside a couple of times during the night. At around 2am the mist had thinned and Jupiter could be seen hazily in the south. By 5am the mist had once again thickened and it wasn’t until 7:30am that I finally crawled outside the tent to greet the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6212374818"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6111/6212374818_d6ed5831b2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6212448866"&gt;&lt;img alt="Last of the cloud in Glen Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6042/6212448866_3f67a04164_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed a pleasant oatmeal breakfast (actually the first time I had mixed my own and it was surprisingly good!) and took my time drying off the tent (as much as possible) and gathering everything back up. It was approaching 9am by the time I actually headed off. The weather wasn't bad so I decided to carry on with a plan that I had formulated the night before: to walk over the Braeriach plateau and return to the car by way of the north end of the Lairig Ghru and a walk back through the Rothiemurchas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6212415580"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scarp 1 besides Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6095/6212415580_306f7d639c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204392661"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Einich" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6204392661_7b230a223b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb up away from the loch was on an excellent stalker's path that didn't seem to have suffered too badly from all the recent rain. I quickly gained height, enjoying the views back over the loch and the encircling hills. A group of DoE types passed me heading off the plateau - it looked like they had spent a dank night somewhere on the heights and all had painfully heavy looking bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204548135"&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching Coire Dhondail" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6204548135_3b5c1551cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6208573613"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waterfall from Coire Bogha-clioche" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6051/6208573613_f9b19c8c83_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I climbed up into Coire Dhondail the views were lost to the mist and cloud and I marched onward, the path continuing to be excellent. After a quick snack I reached the end of the path and struck out for the nearest of Braeriach's subsidiary summits, Carn na Criche. Once off path it was a case of taking a bearing and occasionally verifying my position with GPS. The slopes were somewhat arduous with the ground uneven and greasy but I made it to the small cairn without trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6208586291"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Coire Dhondail" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6125/6208586291_1c6497cd7c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn't much to be seen and once on the exposed plateau a chill wind was blowing the mists to create a saturating kind of dampness that soon had me soaked. Without much ado I turned north and tramped across the plateau to reach Stob Coire an Lochain. The views were equally nonexistent so I took my bearing and struck east until I picked up the path close by the true summit of Braeriach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind had slightly abated and I took some time out to peer into the misty depths revealed by the awesome cliffs and had another snack. It was incredibly quiet on the summit and my early start meant I had the place to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6205158158"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach cliffs" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6025/6205158158_18f60fb859_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6204653819"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach summit cairn" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6126/6204653819_f1eb97645d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this the navigational difficulties were over and I picked up the trade route, dropping east from the summit and following the path as it wound round and down the long, long arm of Sron na Lairig. I started to pass several damp day trippers who were heading for the summit. As the weather once again closed in I was glad to be dropping steadily into the relative shelter of the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the memorial to Sinclair I turned along the Ghru path itself. I chatted to a few people out and about but the main feature of this section was the deep water and sticky bog that had been exacerbated by the continuing rain. Despite the earlier abatement, it was now falling more steadily again. As I lost height I was glad to finally re-enter the forest, dropping down on an excellent path that wends between trees and gives great views out over the narrow gorge of the Allt Druidhe. The trees are starting to take on their magnificent autumn colours, and the mist gave additional atmosphere to this wonderful landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once across the Cairngorm Club footbridge it was an easy amble back through the forest to rejoin my outward track and then the welcome sight of my car. A final highlight on this last stretch was a quiet moment of contemplation besides the incredibly still waters of Lochan Deo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6205252068"&gt;&lt;img alt="Am Beanaidh from the Cairngorm Club Footbridge" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/6205252068_11709840f2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the car it was a pleasure to be able to change out of wet clothes, finish off the packet of Jaffa Cakes and set my sights for home. After more than three months without venturing properly into the Scottish mountains it was great simply to be out there, even if the views were somewhat lacking for much of the outing. It does mean that I shall have to return to Braeriach for a third time in order to get the views!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Loch Avon Overnighter</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-12T19:59:55+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-12T19:59:55+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-06-12:/blog/2011/06/loch-avon-overnighter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 11th-12th June 2011&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a late start from Aberdeen I had set off with my overnight pack from the CairnGorm ski centre at about 4:30pm. Whilst the weather at Cairn Gorm was initially benign - the tops visible and the rain gone - I had driven through a mixture of heavy showers and drizzle all the way from Aberdeen. The rain held off for a good fifteen minutes; just long enough to get far away enough from the car that turning back felt like wimping out. I'd followed the nice signs which led me through the ski area towards the Coire Cas Mountain Trail. It was good to leave behind the ski machinations and after winding my way up a boggy, grassy gully I hit the broad, stoney ridge that climbs up to the head of Coire Raibert. It was a grim plod up through slippery boulders as the rain worsened and the wind rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I reached the summit of Fiacaill a'Choire Chais, where a large group were donning waterproofs behind the cairn, I was all for simply turning away from my planned route, heading up Cairn Gorm and then descending back to the car. However, once over the top and sheltered from the worst of the elements, it was actually quite pleasant. I had never been to this part of the Cairngorms (my nearest encounter was the &lt;a href="/blog/2010/08/bynack-more-and-cairn-gorm/"&gt;summit of Cairn Gorm last August&lt;/a&gt;) and the views were extensive; across the Loch Avon trench to Beinn Mheadhoin, and over to the right the slopes of Ben MacDui. Unfortunately there was still rain and drizzle in the air so the camera remained firmly in its dry bag. Nevertheless, given the better views I decided to push on, now following the clear track that runs along the tops of the Northern Corries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The snow started just a few minutes down the track and didn't let up until I had left the track and crossed marshy ground around the headwaters of the Feith Buidhe. This brought me to a spectacular vantage point looking down onto Loch Avon. There was a already a tent there, pitched on a nice flat area of grass, and this really was the only thing preventing me from stopping for the night right there and then, just over an hour into the walk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5843098709"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Loch Avon trench" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/5843098709_1513bdfebb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improved visibility in the wake of the snow gave me a good view across the tumbling Garbh Usige Beag to the jagged outline that marked the top of the Shelter Stone crag (extreme right of the above photo). This was a second possible area I had considered pitching on so I decided to make me way across there to check out the lie of the land. All the burns were swollen  by rain but the Garbh Uisge Beag, which comes down from just below the summit of Ben MacDui, runs across some wide, flattish areas of red granite which made crossing straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5843648000"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Garbh Uisge Beag" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/5843648000_76fff34813_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the burn crossing it was a gentle five minute pull up to the notch below Carn Etchachan. I dropped the bag and began to hunt around this stoney area for a decent pitch. Level grass was in short supply and I eventually settled on an area of moss and gravel that felt comfy enough and almost level. Most importantly it had an amazing view down to the Loch Avon. Once this was decided I got the tent up just in time for the views to disappear and the cloud to move back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5825629944"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camp above Loch Avon" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5154/5825629944_6c5f273a9d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tent up, I got inside to sort out my gear. Despite almost constant rain and latterly soft, heavy snow, all the gear in my drybags was still perfectly dry including all the down stuff which had been in the back of mind all afternoon. Soon though I was relaxed inside my dry, warm sleeping bag, lying back and listening to the rain drumming on the fly. Occasional looks out revealed a world of swirling cloud and mist. I listened to the latest episode of the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00snr0w"&gt;Infinite Monkey Cage&lt;/a&gt; and made a brew, the stove kept sheltered just outside the tent's porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 8pm the rain finally abated and I opened up the tent to find that the views had been restored. I took a wander about the area, climbing up to Carn Etchachan to get a stunning panorama of the Cairngorms, over Loch Etchachan to the Mounth hills where pockets of cloud drifted lazily between the dark outlines of the mountains. There wasn't a breath of wind, and barely any sign of habitation apart from a couple of tents going up besides Loch Etchachan. My tent looked marooned on a craggy island, the Feith Buidhe beyond it tumbling down to reach Loch Avon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5843151419"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Mounth Hills across Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2776/5843151419_0ca6164b6e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5843155773"&gt;&lt;img alt="A small tent in a big world" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2742/5843155773_4bea55a68c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the tent I enjoyed a Fuizion Food Chilli Con Carne eaten overlooking the loch and then a lazy post dinner cup of coffeee drank as the clouds slowly started to billow up from Strath Nethy to once again cast a veil over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5843716334"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cooking dinner above Loch Avon" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3387/5843716334_f172693f90_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness was a long time coming, hastened only by the thick cloud which was still swirling around the tent at midnight. However, when I next awoke at about 2am, the sky was clear, a gleam of light in the north which cast colours of deep indigo and darkest blue across the sphere above my tent. There was a faint hint of noctilucent clouds seen above the dark outline of the Northern Corries. The temperature had rapidly dropped with the clearing sky so after a few photos it was back to the warmth of my sleeping bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845240663"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Avon before dawn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3272/5845240663_5d7225602b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time I woke it was the dull, still hour before dawn. The light was strange and flat with some cloud hanging in the east. I set my alarm for sunrise and went back to sleep. The eastern cloud foiled the show early on but as I lay in my bag looking out of the tent door the sun finally broke out from behind the cloud and there was the most spectacular light show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845797366"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunrise over Loch Avon" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2690/5845797366_290c008661_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warm sun suffused the tent with a glowing light and the temperature rose again sending me into a dosing sleep. Eventually I forced myself to get out to see how the wider world looked and it was beautiful. In the chilly air I had a hot breakfast and more coffee and then slowly packed everything up to make the most of this most promising of starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845263197"&gt;&lt;img alt="Scarp 1 detail" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2638/5845263197_12d65647e8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845811092"&gt;&lt;img alt="First light on Ben MacDui" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2753/5845811092_46237a8288_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845821360"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tarptent Scarp 1 and Ben MacDui" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5845821360_b9c63a8e66_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had a vague plan at this point, with the main aim of this trip being to bag Beinn Mheadhoin, my last Munro in the central Cairngorms. With Loch Etchachan guarded by crags on two sides I had to take a circuitous route, climbing to Carn Etchachan to enjoy better views than the previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845274155"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Avon" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2588/5845274155_e60949a583_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845278929"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Mount Hills and Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3040/5845278929_0b6f620ce3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845850112"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5845850112_fd6b073b73_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I went along Carn Etchachan's knobbly ridge, keeping above the crags which surround the loch, to eventually get to a point where I could cut across the high land that separates the burn which feeds into Loch Etchachan from the Garbh Uisge Mor. Once here I was able to pick my way across the shallow burn and join the main track that drops down from Ben MacDui to Loch Etchachan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845856050"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reflecting on Ben MacDui" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5268/5845856050_aee2b51404_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845866268"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5319/5845866268_c474eeda97_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was last on this track on a &lt;a href="/blog/2009/05/into-the-heart-of-the-cairngorms/"&gt;misty day in May 2009&lt;/a&gt; where I hadn't really had the best of views. Now though the air was pristine with not a cloud in the sky and I got brilliant views across Etchachan to the high peaks surrounding Loch Avon. The hour was still early so there wasn't too much action around the tents pitched down by the loch. I passed on by, following the clear track that then climbs up the steep western nose of Beinn Mheadhoin. The path is crumbly but soon gets you above the worst of the terrain and the views back across the loch to MacDui were stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845871946"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Gorm beyond Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3415/5845871946_6a51294088_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845336053"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Mheadhoin" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3005/5845336053_ebf086ea82_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845346049"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5151/5845346049_7dfa63fa08_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough I was on the plateau, looking across a number of large and small tors that dot this mountain. The path first heads to the south west top from which I enjoyed views to Cairn Gorm across the mirror-like waters of Loch Avon. I then took the clear track that winds its way between a number of tors to finally reach the biggest one and the one which marks the summit of Beinn Mheadhoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845366997"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beinn Mheadhoin summit plateau" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3628/5845366997_766232d79f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845357355"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben MacDui rises above Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5102/5845357355_58eb2ec687_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845924738"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across Loch Avon to Cairn Gorm" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5032/5845924738_0f3997cf1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pleasant scramble on the north side takes you up to the lofty summit which has views all around to peaks both near and far. Beyond the long line of the Avon I could Ben Rinnes, a dark shape on the far horizon. Nearer, all the peaks had broken free of any remnants of the earlier low cloud whilst further off different clouds were starting to bubble up in the rapidly heating air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took in the views, had a sit down and a sunbathe before returning back to my pack at the foot of the tor. I took a slightly different and more direct return path, enjoying the changing patterns of light and dark as fluffy clouds drifted lazily over the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5846023498"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben MacDui from the summit plateau of Beinn Mheadhoin" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3315/5846023498_17317d7c7d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was more action down by Loch Etchachan by this time and I waved a greeting to someone who was enjoying a brew whilst their stuff aired out in the warm air. I had considered dropping down to Loch Avon and then returning either via Coire Raibert or the Saddle but decided to avoid all this re-ascent and take the longer return route via MacDUi and the path which leads above the eastern rim of the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5846045290"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds creeping over Ben MacDui" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2585/5846045290_2f0ff747b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retraced my steps up the path besides from the loch which then curved round to climb steadily up to the summit of MacDui, my &lt;a href="/blog/2011/05/carn-a-mhaim-and-ben-macdui/"&gt;second time on this summit this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845527967"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Mheadhoin" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5116/5845527967_f465066e45_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still relatively early and no-one else had yet arrived so I enjoyed the peace and solitude, particularly liking the amazing views over to Cairn Toul, Angel's Peak and Breariach which were still snow-rimmed and beautifully detailed in the morning sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845564157"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Gorm from Ben MacDui" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5077/5845564157_d7e5295cc1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845568631"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills around the Garbh Coire from MacDui" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3435/5845568631_f031d73acc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was now on new ground, following the easy track, marked by regular cairns, which leads off MacDui northwards, following a route across the wonderful wildscape of the Cairngorm plateau. The billowing cloud, now rapidly growing to fill the sky, made for some dramatic views with mountains sometimes in bright sunshine and other times in deep shadow. i started to encounter a few people as I passed by the pools above the March Burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845580953"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Angel's Peak" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5186/5845580953_2093502689_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path turned around the lower slopes of Cairn Lochan to give some great views up and down the Lairig Ghru becoming better constructed as the line of cliffs of the Northern Corries came into view. I chatted with a few folk who couldn't believe I was already heading back down to the car park and sympathised that they appeared to be walking into darkening clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5845616579"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3350/5845616579_4742ba2b17_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5846178672"&gt;&lt;img alt="The northern end of the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3062/5846178672_1c423b71c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track took me all the way back down to the car park which I reached just as the first few spots of rain arrived - perfect timing! I chilled out with my shoes off, watching more and more people arrive and head off under the ominous clouds, marvelling that I had been out throughout the perfect weather window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rain splashed off the windscreen as I started the long drive back around to Aberdeen which I reached in time for the heatwave to hit the coast. The rest of Sunday afternoon was spent chilling in the garden whilst my tent and wet weather gear dried off nicely. From snow to sun, it had turned out good in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Carn a' Mhaim and Ben MacDui</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/05/2011-05-08-carn-a-mhaim-and-ben-macdui/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-08T18:02:49+01:00</published><updated>2011-05-08T18:02:49+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-05-08:/blog/2011/05/2011-05-08-carn-a-mhaim-and-ben-macdui/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags: munro

&lt;p&gt;Bacon rolls from Ballater cheered us up a little but it was really the scraps of blue sky that could be glimpsed above the foothills of the Cairngorms that put a proper smile on our faces. The drive to the Linn of Dee had been through rain and ominous skies and although there was a little drizzle falling as we wended our way through the woods, by the time our feet were pounding out the kilometres of the Derry Road it had stopped and the air was muggy and warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Derry Lodge came and went, and after a short break by the river (what &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the midgies up to? Hiding, waiting, plotting and scheming no doubt!) we were on our way, over the stones at Luibeg (some more gracefully than others) and climbing up the shoulder of Carn a' Mhaim. The views back down Lui were lost as we entered the clouds, contoured around below the southern top and skirted a fading snow patch to eventually emerge on the windy summit; just a cairn in the mist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gathered around and eventually the cloud began to blow through, revealing the steep drop to Glen Dee below, and across to the Devil's Point. Whilst waiting for others we dropped slightly off to the north to seek shelter from the gusty wind and found a good perch for lunch. Gradually the mountains began to emerge, although Cairn Toul and MacDui still had their tops in the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we followed the trippy ridge along Carn a' Mhaim, enjoying the sight of the mountain tops shirking their cloud cover. By the time we reached the col below MacDui the cloud had lifted and we could see the spectacular cirque of mountains and coires above the infant River Dee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the col we followed the track up the side of the Tailor's Burn until it fizzled out in the giant boulder field that this ascent is famed for. We clambered, slid, hopped, jumped and waltzed our way up to the plateau at the top, breathing in the marvellous views just as blue spread across the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short walk along the plateau and up the slight rise took us to the summit of Ben MacDui, Britain's second highest mountain, just on 2pm. There were handshakes, photos and attempts to digest the trig point. We went for a wander west to get a better view of the Cairn Toul-Braeriach range and people discussed the legend of the Big Grey Man who was probably somewhere nearby, cowering from the evil yellow one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5699274968"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Toul to Braeriach from Ben MacDui" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2576/5699274968_42c54ecc7d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent route from here was a return to Luibeg via Sron Riach. We did have a quick detour to the top of Stob Coire Sputan Dearg which offered both fine views over the central Cairngorms, and down to Lochan Uaine, as well as the strongest wind we had experienced all day. It was hard to tell but it seemed like flecks of water from the surface of the lochan were being blown into our faces. Still, the slabby summit is an awesome viewpoint and gave us a good look at the descent route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial descent was down a mix of gravel and boulders until we eventually picked up the true track which follows a direct course down towards the Luibeg Burn between Derry Cairngorm and Carn a' Mhaim. We stopped briefly before crossing the river but with thick clouds building all around, decided to make for the Linn of Dee at a fast pace. The return route followed familiar ground, passing Luibeg, Derry Lodge, and then the long road out. This was enlivened by studying the enormous packs of the overnight backpackers heading into the hills (what do they take in there???) and the rain graciously held off until we were back in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a pint at the Fife in Braemar then a speedy return to Aberdeen to complete a long day. Almost 20 miles and 1,300m of ascent in less than 9 hours with some significant stops on summits (almost an hour on MacDui) was impressive going. The fact we didn't get wet or blown off a mountain even more so given the forecast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensifying sunlight drew me from my slumbers and as the brightness
filled the tent I could begin to see the frost glittering on the outside
of the fly. Above me beaded a few drops of condensation on the inner but
this was no great surprise given the calmness of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dozed for half an hour or so, enjoying the warming effect of the
sunlight, before poking my head out at around 7:30am to check on the
world. It was a beautiful start to the day though I’m a bit annoyed that
I failed to get up early enough to watch the sunrise. Long, white
tendrils of cloud were draped over the mountains and the grass sparkled
with frost. Outside the tent it was chilly but the effects of the rising
sun could already be felt. I put on my down vest and set about making
some breakfast. Down by the burn I soon had the stove going and in short
order boiling water for porridge (another Expedition Foods dehydrated
pouch) and a latte. As the sun rose steadily above Beinn Iutharn Mhor it
was quickly getting warmer, hinting at the long hot day to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The porridge was delicious (though I slightly underestimated the amount
of water required this time) and the coffee warmed me up nicely. After
breakfast I had a wander down the burn to wake up the legs and then
returned to slowly pack everything away. The ice on the tent had rapidly
thawed leaving the fly soaking so I left it up to dry as much as
possible in the sunlight. After walking through the bog the previous
evening my shoes and socks were still sopping wet so again I waited
until I was almost ready to go before putting them on. I was able to dry
out other things in the sunlight though (in particular the damp outside
of the sleeping bag) so overall it wasn’t too bad putting everything
back in the pack and the extra space made by the reduction in food
certainly helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I’d ensured that I had everything I was ready to move off, picking
my way uphill and way from the burn, cutting across to reach the low
north-western shoulder of Carn an Righ where I had spotted a track the
previous afternoon. The boggy ground was a brief chore but in the calm
weather and under increasingly clear blue skies it didn’t take long to
begin the climb. There was something of track for most of the ascent
until it got lost in various scree and rock slopes below the summit of
Stac na h-Iolair (I have no idea how that final bit is pronounced…). The
final section to the top was very bouldery but it was a pleasure to
reach the summit in the sunlight, put down the bag, stand back and
admire the beautiful views. I’m sure a summit camp would have given me a
stunning sunrise, but even now the views were superb, Beinn a’ Ghlo very
close at hand and the distant Cairngorms still snowy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the bimble along the broad ridge, picking out a number of
spots that would have made a good campsite, and then made the final
climb up to the summit of Carn an Righ. The substantial summit cairn
provided excellent seating spots with views out in all directions. I
must have spent a good three quaters of an hour up there, enjoying being
on a Munro at 10am after a brisk 45 minute ascent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving I was joined by a guy from Edinburgh who had
walked in from Straloch and spent the night camped at Daldhu. Carn an
Righ was his only objective for the day so he was taking it easy. His
breakfast of fried sausages did make me jealous though – next time! We
shared a few accounts of recent hillwalks and our experiences in these
hills. During this exchange a third guy arrived! I never expected Carn
an Righ to have a crowded summit so early on a Sunday! He had walked in
directly from Glenshee and was soon heading back the way with the aim of
driving across towards the Tarf Hills for a wander up to them the next
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He left and then I had a snack and a drink before heading off myself.
The way ahead was clear, with the drop into the col, then a climb up on
Meall nan Cnapain and finished off by a wander along to Beinn Iutharn
Mhor resplendent in the sunshine. Although I had already climbed this
hill, it was on a dreich day in September and I wanted to get a view
this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent from Carn and Righ is an easy one, a faint path dropping
through a few rocky areas before becoming more distinctive lower down. A
final steepish section drops you down to meet the track coming up from
Fealar Lodge (and my campsite). The water quality looked a little
dubious here so I pushed on, crossing the col and climbing up the steep
slopes of Meall nan Cnapain. The gradient relented soon and then it was
an amble up to the broad plateau and the small summit cairn. Bag off,
drink of water, long sunbathe! I watched a group on the summit of Glas
Tulaichean as well as a couple of folk on Beinn Iutharn Mhor. The sun
was blazing so I applied liberal amounts of sunblock and then settled
down for a quick snooze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit of Beinn Iutharn Mhor was next, reached by dropping to the
bealach (through a band of delicious snow) and then a climb up,
following a good track to the rocky summit area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I was here the ascent had been made into the unwelcoming
arms of a northerly gale. Today was the complete opposite, just a faint
breeze wafting up from the southwest. I reached the summit cairn and
absorbed the stunning views. Despite the haze the Cairngorms and Mounth
Hills, and away south to the Lomonds in Fife, were all visible. Nearby,
the Glenshee Hills and the long sinuous outline of the Glas Maol group
could be seen as well as a great view back to Carn an Righ and onwards
towards An Socach and Beinn Iutharn Beag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I lingered long at the summit, the sun still shining although
more of a breeze was picking up. Then I carried on, following the curve
of the high northern face which looms above the tiny Lochan Uaine below.
The cliffs were impressively corniced, layers of snow starting to slip
inexorably towards the drop off. The path was delightful and I was soon
at the lower eastern top and enjoying the last views of the surrounding
hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, I knew from my last visit, it was a steep descent down the
nose to reach the boggy ground above Altanour Lodge. I took in the
stunning view down over Glen Ey and then continued on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My water was almost gone by this point and although I descended quickly,
picking up a clear path, I then lost it in the boggy morass above the
river. I struggled on, squelching through mossy pools and struggling
through thick, knee-high heather until finally, and with some relief I
again came across the proper path again. Just a few more minutes and I
was at the crossing over the Alltan Odhar where I threw off the pack and
bounded down to the stream for a refreshing head dip and a drink. I went
through about 1.5 litres of deliciously crisp mountain water in a
minute. Thirst quenched I continued on the short distance to the ruin at
Altanour where it was time for a spot of lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the trees and with a little breeze for company it was a great spot
to stop. I chatted with a couple who emigrated to Australia but always
come back to Scotland each year to enjoy the countryside. They had just
wandered up Glen Ey and were returning the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing off the last of my oatcakes I too was ready to head down
Glen Ey. In the golden afternoon sunlight the glen looked glorious, the
Ey Water meandering back and forth across the flats, the heather clad
slopes rising steeply on either side, and a set of Northern Lapwings
wheeling and tumbling and letting out their strange ululating calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These all helped pass the time, particularly as the long miles on the
good vehicle track were sapping at the feet. Eventually I rounded the
corner and could see the second ruin in the distance, indicating I was
almost at the car. There was excitement just here when I came across a
snake dozing on the path. As soon as it got wind of me it slithered off
and was lost in the undergrowth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the final drop down hill and before I knew it I was retracing
my steps down, through the gate, past the houses and out to the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total trip time was some 29 hours car-to-car with 15 of those spent
at the campsite and at least 2.5-3 hours spent relaxing on summits and
by burns and taking photographs. Therefore I covered a total distance of
45km in just 11 hours of hiking – not bad going with an 8.5kg starting
load! I’ve posted a &lt;a href="/blog/2011/04/carn-an-righ-wild-camp-the-gear/"&gt;full gear
report&lt;/a&gt; but suffice to say
at this point that the heros of the trip were my battered and bruised
TNF Hedgehog Trail Shoes, my Icebreaker long-sleeved base layer and my
PHD Down Sleeping Bag and Gillet. I’ll remember this trip for a long
time to come. It had all the essentials of a great camping trip – long
distances, wild places and stunning views. Everything seemed to work out

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening. The sun has slunk below the horizon, ashamed of its lack of show. Clouds drift lazily through a dark sky. Somewhere near the tent a snuffling is heard, a deer or sheep tugging gently at the tussocky grass I'm camped on. By the time I look out it has gone. Back inside, I draw the sleeping bag tight around my face and lay back, listening to the burn murmuring gently to my right. Life is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday evening. The sun has slunk below the horizon, ashamed of its lack of show. Clouds drift lazily through a dark sky. Somewhere near the tent a snuffling is heard, a deer or sheep tugging gently at the tussocky grass I'm camped on. By the time I look out it has gone.

&lt;p&gt;The day  began with an early start, not to get to the hills this time, but to watch the Grand Prix qualifying session and make some last minute food choices for the trip ahead. The sunlight streaming through the window was a good sign, as was the upgraded weather forecast on the MWIS site that was now promising 90% chance of cloud free Munros and a negligible wind on Sunday. I transferred the rain gear from my main bag into the car bag and never gave it another thought thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635403437"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fully loaded Osprey rucksack" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5110/5635403437_4805095194_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lazy start saw me leaving Aberdeen at 9:15, and enjoying a sunny drive down Deeside, despite some of the usual Saturday drivers getting out and about. This was compounded by getting caught up in the &lt;a href="http://www.granitecityrally.co.uk/"&gt;Granite City Rally&lt;/a&gt; convoy, with a series of Lancers, Suburus and support vehicles taking it easy along the South Deeside Road. By the time I arrived at the car park at Inverey it was already busy with folk sorting out gear and bicycles. Handily for me, with all the preparation done at home (I was even wearing my socks and trail shoes), I was out of the car, on with the sack and off in just a minute or two. The sunshine in Aberdeen had faded under grey skies around Braemar with sullen clouds sitting over the Cairngorms. I wasn't deterred though as MWIS had promised a brightening day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635404173"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ready to start" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5222/5635404173_26d00b30a6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635984420"&gt;&lt;img alt="The bridge that wasn't there" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5635984420_9f9bf39453_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a slightly inauspicious start. A few weeks ago when planning this route I had decided to stay low initially and walk along the road to the Linn of Dee, then pick up the track to White Bridge before turning south towards the Tilt. However, during the week I had the map out again and changed my mind, deciding instead to cut across the hills to Bynack Lodge and so avoid the road walking section. I checked out the 1:25,000 map online which confidently marked a bridge across the Ey Water just up from the road and so dutifully trekked up to this point from the car park. Disaster! The bridge was gone. Checking the map it was going to be a long walk along the pathless east side of the burn but I decided to give it a go rather than backtracking to the car park. Luckily a reasonable looking path cut through the heather in the direction I was going so feeling a little more confident I followed this. It proved to be an enjoyable and dramatic route, keeping close to the edge of the gorge down which the Allt Cristie tumbles. The path continued for a good way, eventually becoming lost in boggier ground higher up. My luck continued though and I soon spotted a narrow point where it was easy to cross, followed by a short scramble up through dead trees to reach the main vehicle track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635406159"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Allt Cristie Mor" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5185/5635406159_76a2a94265_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635406959"&gt;&lt;img alt="Top of the Battery" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5635406959_90353b5378_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635987548"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn Mor" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5262/5635987548_ea6713ddd8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point it was a long but gradual ascent with the views gradually opening up until I arrived at the bealach below Carn Liath. A short diversion got me to the summit of this broad backed hill which is at Corbett height but lacks sufficient prominence to get on a list. It's a good vantage point for the main Cairngorms to the north, though they were largely shrouded in heavy clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635988718"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms from Carn Liath" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5307/5635988718_9513381452_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635410841"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Ghlo from Carn Liath" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5635410841_47961ffd56_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind was cold and so I didn't pause long before heading off, following the contours around a boggy corner to get onto the broad connecting ridge running west to Buaichaille Breige. This was the first of three rounded bumps that I traversed, enjoying excellent views all around. In particular I got a good first sighting of Carn an Righ, the primary objective of this trip, as well as the northern end of Beinn a' Ghlo and the wilds of the Blair Atholl forest, south of the distinctive line of the Geldie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635994986"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn an Righ" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5635994986_ce05c36232_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the line of hills I came to a steep descent with views down to Bynack Lodge and along towards White Bridge. It wasn't exactly an ideal slope, particularly with a loaded backpack, but my plan was to cross the river here rather than try and get across further upstream, so I made my careful way down the heathery slopes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635416863"&gt;&lt;img alt="The west top of Buachaille Breige" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5301/5635416863_12b1ef6045_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635418823"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Geldie" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5302/5635418823_9b7f7c101a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was nearing the bottom a group of cyclists came along the track from the direction of Glen Tilt, all towing yellow carts behind them, and each one adorned with a yellow flag. It was a strange sight, and quite comical watching each of them try and get across the stream without dismounting. A couple made it but several of them got half way, swayed and faltered and ended up with damp feet. They regrouped and moved off as I approached the ford, able to pick my way across rocks without getting wet feet. Just up from here I came to the ruins of Bynack Lodge where I decided to stop for a spot of lunch. By this time faint blue patches were appearing in between breaks in the cloud and in the glen it was feeling much warmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635420845"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruins of Bynack Lodge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5635420845_fdd5482a0d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a pleasant lunch of oatcakes, cheese and chorizo taken on the banks of the Bynack burn I wandered on, heading down the broad glen on a good track under increasingly blue skies. This is quite simply beautiful walking country with the hills climbing away on either side of the broad river. Behind me the clouds around the Cairngorms were lightening in colour. The vehicle track soon turned into a single footpath that kept to a good line above the floor of the glen and so was largely dry underfoot. A couple of boggy sections were easy to negotiate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636005324"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track south" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5636005324_29ba12e02b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636006596"&gt;&lt;img alt="North towards the Cairngorms" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5103/5636006596_c184f50a1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635427765"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track above the Allt an t-Seilich" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5635427765_174763412d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a bend in the glen I turned to take a final look at the Cairngorms which I wouldn't see again until much later in the day. Ahead the view down the infant Tilt was dominated by the great Beinn a' Ghlo massif, the corries and ridges of Carn nan Gabhar, glimpsed through the narrow gorge of the Allt Garbh Buidhe looking positively Alpine under patchy blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636009024"&gt;&lt;img alt="South to Beinn a' Ghlo" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5636009024_ce2d15c482_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635430387"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down the Allt Garbh Buidhe" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5190/5635430387_b8af62ccc1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636011062"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sron a' Bhoididh" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5149/5636011062_285afebe6a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before entering the gorge there is a section of straight grassy track which was dry and springy and in these conditions simply has to be one of the best footpaths in the country. The views and situation just beautiful. I lingered in the sunshine, listening to the gentle rippling of the stream and the occasional call of birds wheeling on the warming air. With no other person in sight, and the faint path the only mark of humanity, it was like stepping into Tolkien. I ambled on, humming a walking song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636011716"&gt;&lt;img alt="The perfect path" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5636011716_6e3129cb51_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635433869"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mountain stream" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5147/5635433869_d18fc542fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636013952"&gt;&lt;img alt="Entering the gorge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5636013952_05465baba2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path dropped steadily beside the tumbling river, held in by the steep enclosed walls. Beinn a' Ghlo came steadily closer until the walls relented, the river slowed to a more gentle pace. After passing the point where I would climb away from the Tilt I continued on just a short distance to visit the Tarf Falls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636015248"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clearing skies" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5150/5636015248_b3a91fc585_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the River Tarf tumbles down from the high country in a series of dramatic falls before joining with the Tilt and heading south and deeper into Perthshire. A suspension bridge, built at the end of the 19th century, spans the Tarf and carries the path on its continuing course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635438841"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tarf Falls" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5635438841_11b9cabae1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636022506"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_7294" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5187/5636022506_861e61d89b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was as far as the Tilt was taking me though and I took the opportunity, after viewing the falls from the bridge, to relax for a few minutes on the stretch of springy turf north of the confluence. The sunshine was wonderfully warming, shimmering on the water and lighting up the new spring growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635440277"&gt;&lt;img alt="Suspension Bridge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5263/5635440277_94401f6f5e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retraced my steps, climbing back up the gorge and then following a path that branched off down to the Tilt where I picked a way across the swift river using rocks and partially submerged boulders. On the far bank I picked up a track that zig-zagged steeply up the far slope, climbing high above the narrow glen containing the Allt a' Ghlinne Mhoir. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635446245"&gt;&lt;img alt="Leaving Glen Tilt" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5308/5635446245_dd74ce3bc3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5636026294"&gt;&lt;img alt="Westward toward the Tarf Hills" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5103/5636026294_d6bae0d32e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to come across a few sheep and then caught sight of Carn an Righ and Beinn Iutharn Mhor, now very close by. The track followed the glen until it turned sharply northward passing through several fences until I reached the collection of pink buildings at Fealar Lodge. There was a calamitous barking of dogs of all shapes and sizes from an outbuilding but there was no sign of human life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped down to the bridge across the Allt Geith Lair and followed the faint track that climbed up onto the Miadan Mor. The farm buildings were soon lost to sight and once again the high Cairngorms appeared over the northern hills. They were much clearer now although the clouds had once again started rolling in from the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once over the ridge below Carn Dearg I had a perfect view across to Carn an Righ and down into the quiet glen through which flowed the Allt a' Ghlinne Bhig. I immediately spotted the area of green turf that is described in &lt;a href="http://phreerunner.blogspot.com/2009/05/tgo-challenge-2009-day-10-wilderness.html"&gt;Phreerunner's 2009 TGO Challenge blog post&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="http://summitandvalley.blogspot.com/2008/12/tgo-challenge-2007.html"&gt;Martin Rye's 2007 TGO Challenege report&lt;/a&gt;. I dropped down, following the path before cutting down through the heather to the banks of the burn. There was no obvious clear way across so I took off shoes and socks, rolled up my trousers and waded across at a fairly benign section. Cold it most certainly was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635454555"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Iutharn Mhor" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5269/5635454555_c7bc1dda49_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised in the reports the area was perfect for a camping spot - springy grass, flat, plenty of water and with great views in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635456319"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Iutharn Mhor" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5181/5635456319_5f40a273c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking out the areas immediately up and downstream I settled on an area just up from the very large area of tussock and pitched the tent. There was a slight breeze blowing and the clouds had obscured the sun. With the tent up and my gear unpacked I set about making dinner and then spent the best part of two hours relaxing, enjoying the changing light, exploring the area above the tent, and drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun sank into the clouded west without a show and as it got chillier I retired to the tent to listen to a little music before turning in for the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5635467973"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking west near sunset" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5310/5635467973_2ddc4163f7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't get a perfect night's sleep, waking on occasion as the temperature changed and my body readjusted. I got out of the tent at around 2am. By this time the clouds had begun to part and the Full Moon was shining brightly, illuminating the landscape with its magical, silvery light. I spent a few minutes wrapped up in my down vest taking some pictures and looking at the stars. It was silent except for the river.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5628330687"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light Pollution" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5190/5628330687_b406990b1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the tent I once again settled down, tossing and turning a little as my body grew accustomed to the air mattress. I remember last looking at my watch at 3:30am and the next thing I knew the sun was beginning to light up the inner and a new day was beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's probably a little piece of Eastern mysticism relating to the fact that a little wind never hurt anyone. I was repeating this mantra to myself every step of the way along the broad and exposed ridge that curves around to the summit of Creagan a' Chaise, a Graham perched high above Speyside and close to the infamous Haughs of Cromdale. It marked the high point of Sunday's walk along the spine of the Hills of Cromdale which divide Glen Livet and the River Avon from the green fields of Strath Spey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's probably a little piece of Eastern mysticism relating to the fact that a little wind never hurt anyone. I was repeating this mantra to myself every step of the way along the broad and exposed ridge that curves around to the summit of Creagan a' Chaise, a Graham perched high above Speyside and close to the infamous Haughs of Cromdale. It marked the high point of Sunday's walk along the spine of the Hills of Cromdale which divide Glen Livet and the River Avon from the green fields of Strath Spey.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We started at the side of the A95, just south of the picturesque Tormore distillery. Here a gated track leads off up the hillside to Tom a' Chait with its communications paraphernalia. The track isn't overly walker friendly initially with a small herd of nervous looking cattle and deep, churned mud, as well as a gate that needs climbing over. However, once past these obstacles the track provided good access to the hills and we ascended fairly rapidly into the oncoming gale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a relief to reach the shelter of the buildings which cluster around the summit of Tom a' Chait. The higher hills of Cromdale could now be seen, striking off in a south-westerly direction with a dusting of snow and a murky cap of tattered cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5464509212"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5464509212_1efb5c3cda_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We crossed a boggy bealach and then picked up the ridge proper where the heather was less overgrown and the ground generally firmer. As we climbed up onto Creag an Tarmachain we found that we had previously under-estimated the strength of the wind. It was very strong indeed, a ferocious, biting gale that whipped straight across from the frozen Cairngorms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this point all thoughts of conversation were forgotten. Hoods were drawn in to their narrowest opening and every buff, scarf and hat was pulled from bags and put on. Making progress was tough going and after we had passed the crags we found a steep snow slope down which we descended to get some shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we had a bite of lunch (a late start from Aberdeen and a long drive across country meant that it was already late morning by this point) before continuing on. Though we were under heavy cloud the views north and west were quite expansive, the sunlight dappling Strath Spey and a ring of snow capped peaks visible on a hazy horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5463908731"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5173/5463908731_04b69c6e27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again we ascended to the ridge-line and continued south-west, following a snowy set of vehicle tracks that gradually ascended the gentle eastern slopes of Carn a'Ghille Chearr. As we gained height we entered into dense cloud which significantly reduced vsibility and lent a strange, ghostlike quality to the surroundings. The vehicle tracks led us to a point some distance west of the summit trig point, just visible through the mist. We made for this and were soon standing on top of the day's first Graham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5463910845"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5463910845_d9e2d12db6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Views were non-existent sadly so after a very brief stop we continued on our way, following faint tracks and keeping to the broad crest of the ridge. It was a challenge to keep everyone together at this time but as we descended and passed the small bump of Carn Eichie we gradually came out of the mist and sight was restored. We now had another boggy bealach to cross to reach our next objective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5464512936"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5178/5464512936_c3ea17a03c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5463914483"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5137/5463914483_096e8ca79c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it was declared hightime for another break and as we got lower down the wind relented somewhat, our position protected to some degree by An Sgoran. By the bank of a snow-choked trickle of a burn we stopped for some more food and to take on hot drinks. The views across the Haughs of Cromdale and further west towards the Cairngorm plateau were splendid, though everywhere continued to be hazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5465678941"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5465678941_d9d27dd4f8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5466275302"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5058/5466275302_ffb43b67dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the break we continued on our way, crossing the bealach and then climbing up another rising slope that took us on a path north and west of An Sgoran. It was an unrelenting ascent with the terrain difficult underfoot and we were all very glad to reach the large cairn which sits high above the strath commanding a wide vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From it, a more distinct path was picked up which led us on to the north shoulder of Creagan a' Chaise. The terrain was undulating tussocky grass and heavy that had had a liberal sprinkling of snow such that every other step threw you off balance. It wasn't helped by the return of the wind which hadn't lost any of its earlier force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5462945414"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5462945414_4ebcfb7f84_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5465683883"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5465683883_257c00f9f3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually we reached the final steep slope up to the trig point and cairn which gave a nice snowy ascent up consolidated white stuff until at last we were on the top of our final summit for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5466294244"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5133/5466294244_44246e251e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent a few minutes enjoying the fine views and then, conscious of the time, decided to start our descent. Although it would have ultimately been more sensible to have descended to the small col immediately west of the summit, we instead dropped off the south side, going down through bands of stones and heather until we angled down to the March Burn which descends from the col higher up. Here we had to drop to the burn, cross it, and then climb up a steep, mossy and damp bank to regain the higher ground. At least the wind had dropped by this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5465688831"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5465688831_c5ce33f1f8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this and another short break in the sheltered gulley, we continued the descent which took us over a broad shoulder of land and eventually through a fence to the farm at Lyntelloch. From here a good track took us all the way down to the coach waiting at the Bridge of Brown to complete an excellent, albeit windy, traverse of the Hills of Cromdale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially we followed the "Old Pine Trees" waymarked route that passes the chapel and then climbs up to the viewpoint which gives a sweeping view across the Caledonian pines and southwards to the tree-clad hill of Strone with a snow-smattered Clachan Yell beyond. From here we dropped down to the Water of Tanar and turned left to follow the south bank on a good track that enabled us to make rapid progress through the still woods. We had a couple of twists and turns to make, one taking us on an old stone bridge across the Water of Allachy, and then we were climbing steeply up the lower slopes of White Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419463939"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5094/5419463939_de11520e67_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb through the woods was pleasant; not too boggy, and without any of the ice-related problems that had plagued the Kerloch walk a couple of weeks ago. It was already clear that a major thaw had occurred over the past week or so, removing the remaining snow on anything but northern slopes up to 700-750m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track levelled off, then dropped steadily before climbing once again as the trees thinned and we came out onto the open hillside. With the Water of Gairney on our left hand side we now had expansive views towards Cock Cairn and beyond. We followed the track for some distance as White Hill dropped down to its col with Clachan Yell. As the shallow corrie dropped to meet the track we cut up through the heather, aiming for the summit of Clachan Yell. It was a surprisingly long climb, steep and uneven initially as we pushed up through the thick, clinging heather. The gradient eased however as we passed through snow patches and then it was a long pull up to the distinctive tor which sits to the east of the true summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419465233"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5251/5419465233_313d77df7d_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arrived first and dropped my sack to enjoy an easy scramble up the tumble of boulders to reach the top. There is various ironwork around here, including a large metal post drilled into the uppermost stone. Once I climbed up here I was treated to the full force of the icy westerly wind which was whipping across from the higher mountains. It was almost strong enough to knock me off my feet, so I went on all fours to the edge of the rock and sat, watching the rest of the guys make their way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5420076970"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5420076970_753fa84305_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the views were expansive. Nearby the hills above Glen Tanar stretched out to circle the glen. Bennachie was a dark shape on the horizon and further east, Lochnagar and the Cairngorms were hunkering down under dark clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419475267"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5139/5419475267_f091e70862_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others gradually made it to the top and then we dropped off the summit to seek some respite from the wind. The massive top stone proved to have a "roomy" shelter under it so we clambered in here to have elevenses. Tea and various food items were consumed whilst we enjoyed the view back east towards the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419349836"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5140/5419349836_07f660d112_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we went up onto the summit proper for a few photos and to take in the views which also now included Mt Keen, the most easterly Munro, and the target of my last walk up Glen Tanar back in Nov 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5418744717"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5251/5418744717_9661ef0a36_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan from here was to move along this short chain of hills and then drop into Glen Tanar for the walk back up the glen. We dropped down the heather slopes of Clachan Yell and then made the somewhat shorter up climb back up through heather and icy snow patches to the wide summit of Black Craig. The skies by now were a brilliant blue, streaked by high cloud and contrails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5420082284"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5420082284_6eae3750e5_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views to Lochnagar and beyond were improving as we got closer, and the sun was now shining brightly having shed some of the earlier haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5420088798"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5052/5420088798_01652f5806_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Craig led to Red Craig which had a very minor cairn on its summit and gave great views down into Glen Tanar. At this point we decided against continuing on to Gathering Cairn and so descended south from Red Craig until we crossed a somewhat dilapidated fence and picked up the vehicle track which we had left to ascend Clachan Yell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419494611"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5419494611_e008181d6c_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track, icy in places but with expansive views towards the head of Glen Tanar, got us down to the Water of Tanar where we found a rocky beach to have lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419490943"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5300/5419490943_2fcb42d22a_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sun glinted off the chattering river and Mount Keen stood starkly silhouetted to the south. Lunch was a relaxed affair and then we picked our way along the riverbank until we joined up with the main track that runs through the glen. A couple of people decided they wanted to test their gaters and so crossed the river upstream of the bridge, combining elegant steps across stones with a final wade through the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5419354052"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5212/5419354052_ca11c8bc4d_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now a simple matter of walking back along the track to the car park at Millfield. The sunshine was pleasant on our backs on the open part of the route and then illuminated the ancient Caledonian pine forest as we passed Half Way Hut and wound around the corner past the lochan (still frozen), then past the house, across the fields and back to the car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car park at the Linn of Dee was eerily quiet. There were only a few cars huddled together at the far side nearest the track leading off to Glen Lui. As I was booting up a few folk passed through on mountain bikes. These were to be the last people I would see until returning to Derry Lodge later in the day. WIth crampons and ice axe safely stowed in my pack I was away, heading up the familiar slope away from the car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5400992467"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5017/5400992467_4df3c47e1f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world was cold and grey, colour sapped out of the ground and the sky by a low flat light. There was no wind and the quiet soon became peaceful rather than eerie. The still woods gave out to the wide glen containing the Lui water. I hit my stride quickly, soon warming up and enjoying the crunch of gravel beneath my boots, dodging around ribbons of treacherously polished ice. Ahead of me the mountains above Derry Lodge were capped by thick cloud. Nevertheless I held onto the idea that MWIS would be right, and that by midday those clouds would be in tatters, blown away on a brisk northerly wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5400996889"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5097/5400996889_47707b8173_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Derry Road is familiar ground, having walked it on four previous occasions. I covered the distance quickly and was soon at the Lodge where I caught a distant sight of the dismounted cyclists making their way across the flats towards Glen Luibeg. I followed their route initially but after crossing the Derry by the footbridge turned right onto new ground, a track that wound its way across marshy tussocks to then follow the course of the Derry north into the heart of the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5404087316"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5179/5404087316_ffc0b6acbb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of wending through the woods, the track came back to the waterside and I stopped for a drink and some food. A watery sun was now visible through the hazy clouds and its light bounced sharply off the chattering stream, still encased in ice in many places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5403491209"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5251/5403491209_1bf9fed1d0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this pleasant break I pushed on, following the track as it slowly climbed the glen. A shower passed overhead as I crossed the Derry to join the main track which runs up to the pass of the Lairig an Laoigh. The mountains, high and wild looking, began to climb on either side now, the snow line getting closer and closer. The glen was utterly deserted, neither animal or human stirred in the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5403489477"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5294/5403489477_96d81e0e8b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I reached the Glas Allt Mor, tumbling down from the col below Beinn aâ€™ Chaorainn. This is a serious stream and it was only through careful use of my pole that I got across with dry feet. Shortly after this a track forked off to the left, climbing up towards Loch Etchachan. I carried on though as the path turned to climb the slopes below Beinn aâ€™ Chaorainn, up to the pass of the Laoigh. I briefly caught sight of the Murchison Hut below Etchachan and the track winding its way up to that high loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5404096212"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5098/5404096212_214f4f6d13_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5400697439"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5300/5400697439_16f0427b08_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climbing the pass had taken me closer to the cloud base and now the world was increasingly white, visibility reduced to just a short distance ahead. It made the climb above me look very dramatic and intimidating, the steep slope disappearing off to an unguessed point above me. At first progress was good, but I soon hit compacted neve, slightly blue in colour, scored into shallow ripples by the wind, and hard as steel. Kicking my boot in made barely any impression and so it was on with the crampons and out with the axe. After this progress was much better and I was able to cleanly front point up a steep snow slope until I reached the ridge line where the contours flattened out. I now took a quick bearing to the summit and made my way up. The cloud occasionally thinned to give a fleeting view back down into the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I avoided the craggy edge above the Lairig and so traversed a slight depression before hitting the southwest ridge. Up this I went, watching the horizon for a sign. Within just a few minutes the terrain again levelled off and now my crampons were catching on protruding rocks that had had much of their snow blasted away. The cairn came into view and I gladly touched it, my first Munro of 2011 and number 101.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5404098606"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5018/5404098606_5cf6535268_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick check to confirm there wasnâ€™t a view in any direction I sat down on the sheltered side of the cairn to have some lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5400227245"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5095/5400227245_688617203e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sat there conditions improved slightly, the sun peering warily through the clouds and the occasional scraps of blue sky appearing above. It sadly wasnâ€™t the great clearing that MWIS had promised, at least not yet, so after a short break I continued on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5400547253"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5256/5400547253_00394a2fc8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After removing my crampons I made excellent progress along what must surely be one of the easiest traverses between two Munros. The wide south ridge runs out into the vast expanse of the Moine Bheadlaidh, an undulating tract of frozen, snow-covered marsh that stretches between Glen Derry and the vast bulk of Beinn aâ€™ Bhuird to the east. There wasnâ€™t much of a view, but the feeling of space, isolation and wilderness were intense and beguiling. Coming across the occasional pool of dark water was a strange moment for the eyes, dazed by the brightness. Later they were caught by a fleeting sun dog which appeared in the sky to the west of the hazy sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as the clouds thickened and steady, powdery snow began to fall, the great mass of Beinn Bhreac appeared with both the eastern and western tops visible. Initially the slopes looked steep and snow covered but as I got closer it became apparent that it was just a gentle rise up towards the broad summit plateau. For the first time since the Lairig road I came across footprints just below the cairn but the place was entirely deserted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily though, as the day drew towards its close, the views were improving. As the sun dropped further down it found chinks in the cloud and now lit up Glen Lui and the hills of Sgor Dubh and Sgor Mor. After another brew and a final bite to eat (or was it a pot of jelly?) I reluctantly left my perch amongst the clouds and started the descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5403503855"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/5295/5403503855_e8e472cb2f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slopes here are fairly gentle so I made good progress, glissading down a couple of steeper sections until I finally picked up a track which curved down below Meall and Ludan, aiming roughly for the trees in Glen Derry. I had half thought to continue over the hill and miss out the trip back to Derry Lodge but with light beginning to feel I felt safer heading for a known track, than for trying to get across a hillside as darkness fell. As I dropped down towards the trees the light snow turned thicker and wetter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5403504687"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/5095/5403504687_3b3c385311_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was soon amongst the trees and then scrambling along a boggy track to emerge on the main track up from Derry Lodge. It was of course now that I looked up and saw that all the surrounding peaks, from Derry Cairngorm, past Beinn Mheadhoin to Beinn Bhreac were now sailing cleanly in a clear blue sky! Beinn Mheadhoin was the most impressive, it's great southern flank just catching the bright sunlight. The snow now finally stopped and I was able to shed a layer to enjoy the still, fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5404105874"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/5057/5404105874_ccbb77612b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned my back on the mountains and made my way down the enjoyable track to Derry Lodge and then back along the Derry Road. The clear evening's presence was noticeable by the sudden drop in temperature and the subtle shifting of light. The return journey was uneventful, steadily racking up the miles until I returned through the woods, held deep in the gloaming, to reach the car as the light finally failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orion kept me company on the long journey back to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civilised 8am start, as dawn broke over Aberdeen, coupled with a continuation of high pressure and a promising forecast brought out a healthy crowd of folk for the first coach walk of 2011. The large coach made the journey through the back roads south of Banchory quite exciting, but after only one wrong turn, plus the sight of Doug sprinting down a lane, we arrived at the drop-off point just to the west of Knockburn Loch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were soon booted up and heading south on a broad track that led directly to the foot of Kerloch. Above us streaks of denim-blue cloud were fizzling away in the rising sun and the skies were increasingly clear. Underfoot the ground was hard, and frozen puddles were to be avoided if you werenâ€™t up for trying out some gymnastic manoeuvres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5380749982"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5380749982_7e5cfcf8cd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A steady pace was set by the leaders and we were soon climbing up towards the tree line with the town of Banchory now visible in the wide valley of the River Dee. The sunlight was lighting up a patchwork of fields, deceptively green for late January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5384944933"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5213/5384944933_7c9ef98966_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slight pause we made our way up the zigzagging track, now with increasing levels of hardened snow and ice underfoot. Between the tall rows of dark pines on the north side of this hill there will have been no sunlight for several months. Out of the trees the views opened up magnificently, showcasing Royal Deeside from the apartment blocks of Aberdeen out to the distant cloud-wreathed Cairngorms. Above us streaky cirrus clouds now dominated the deep blue winter sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385526482"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5385526482_5552645d85_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main track was left to climb up on a narrow winding path between heather to finally reach the summit, decorated with both a cairn and a trig point for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385383381"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5385383381_1f472c6368_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views were spectacular with the Angus hills, Mount Keen, Mayar and Dreish, Morven, Clachnaben and Mount Battock all visible and distant hills glimpsed through haze and high cloud. Aberdeenshire rolled away to the north and the sea glinted in the morning sunlight. There was a strong wind so photos were taken, the view admired and then the summit was left behind to find a more sheltered spot for a bit of elevenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rejoined the main track that now winds its way south towards the Fetteresso forest and had a short break on a sheltered corner, basking in the sunshine.  After this we continued on, following the track as it cut a winding course through tree-clad slopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385990316"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5213/5385990316_cd87785793_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views out to Clachnaben and hills further west  opened up as we made our way down into a wide glen. After dropping down through a fire break, a dark corridor of pines with the needles soft and springy underfoot, we had an adventurous detour, crossing a burn twice and negotiating a steep and icy hillside. Eventually though we were back on track, climbing up beside the tumbling burn before crossing it and then climbing up marshy land to a wide saddle below The Builig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385960752"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5385960752_9a7708e841_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midday sunshine this gave excellent walking and we made good progress along the broad top until we came to the head of the West Burn of Builig where we paused for a lunchtime snack. We now enjoyed fine views across wooded slopes south towards the Mearns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385358603"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5220/5385358603_5a64a7e176_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, and another slight navigational hiccup we picked up the icy track that dropped down beside the West Burn. As the sun dropped the air began to feel appreciably cooler and underfoot the ground was ever more treacherous. As it dropped the Burn grew wider until it was more river like and we followed a vehicle track along its bank until we reached another junction south of Turf Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385984972"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5385984972_e13a7fc322_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in a dark valley the sunlight had not penetrated for some time and the ground was ever more icy. As we were now about to climb a long slope out and over the next rise I decided to try out my new Pogu Spikes â€“ minicrampons that slip on over whatever footwear you happen to be wearing. These proved to be brilliant, their sharp spikes finding good purchase on the various grades of ice and snow that we encountered on the long climb up below Gaerlie. At times the gravel reappeared and I had to slip them off but I never lost too much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5385370447"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5385370447_50ccc28a9e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After another wander along an open hillside, cutting through trees, we dropped down one last time, now below the Hill of Burnieshag. Eventually this wound around and then dropped steeply down into the Drumtochty Forest. Hidden deep in a cold glen this track was again icy (though it didnâ€™t seem to be putting off the mountain biker we met coming the other way!) and so we made our way carefully down the last kilometre until we found the coach waiting for us in the North Drumtochty car park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A pleasant pint was enjoyed at the Station Hotel in Stonehaven before a winding, atmospheric journey across the Slug Road to drop people off at Crathes before finally making it back to Aberdeen after a long but enjoyable day.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Coyles of Muick</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/01/2011-01-03-the-coyles-of-muick/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-03T23:02:49+00:00</published><updated>2011-01-03T23:02:49+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-01-03:/blog/2011/01/2011-01-03-the-coyles-of-muick/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags:

&lt;p&gt;The "Hogmany Hoolie" is the Stocket's annual post-New Year detox walk that this year saw a healthy turnout ready for a gentle jaunt around the Coyles of Muick above Ballater. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was some initial confusion which ended up with me driving on my own to the start of the walk where I caught up with everyone else who had sensibly car-shared. I blame the early start! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the temperature was low, the roads were in good condition and it was a pleasant drive out of the city and along the Dee under skies that showed some sign of clearing. Unfortunately by the time I passed through Ballater it was distinctly greyer up above and Lochnagar was hidden from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was sorted with boots and bag, I joined the rest of the troops and we headed away from the cars along a good forest path that soon passed the frozen Loch Ullachie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320364531"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5320364531_c169f6134d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-one was foolish enough to try their luck on the ice though and we soon moved on, following the track is it climbed up between tall pines. The ground was frozen and quite treacherous in places but we managed to pick our way up without mishap. The air under the trees was still and with the climb uphill everyone quickly warmed up and hats and gloves were discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320974542"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5246/5320974542_21ff4aa957_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paused at the edge of the forest for a quick brew before taking to the open hillside, following the forest boundary as it turned south and slightly east. From here, as we followed a narrow frozen track we got dramatic views south and east to Lochnagar which the cloud was sitting over in a determined sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320732300"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5244/5320732300_c3358ed675_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we climbed towards Meall Dubh we also got a fleeting sighting of a couple of deer on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320748290"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5205/5320748290_d4db86e8d9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They moved off quickly as we approached and soon we found ourselves ascending the final steep and icy slopes up to the summit. From it, bracing ourselves against a bitterly cold wind, we got great views over Lochnagar and back to Ballater with a cloud-capped Morven beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320410961"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5086/5320410961_5bd283fb3f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we could also now clearly see our main target for the day: the triple peaks that make up the Coyles of Muick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5320907854"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5128/5320907854_73242f5538_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We glissaded our way down to the howff below Meall Dubh where a dram of whisky was found and shared around. After this fortification we turned towards the Coyles, quickly crossing the snow-speckled heather and frozen peat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323886972"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5202/5323886972_876bc557fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323278457"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5323278457_fd8254b118_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent was again icy, the ground hard and unforgiving but the climb was not that taxing and we were soon on the lumpy plateau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323285631"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5041/5323285631_2699bf515c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323894052"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5164/5323894052_fd5c535036_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the east summit, which we visited first, there is a large cairn which gives views over Deeside and towards the Mounth hills and Mount Keen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323897696"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5210/5323897696_00e9d9b1e3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323905048"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5002/5323905048_6cc771514d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then crossed to the true summit which had superb views of Lochnagar, once more wreathed in cloud, and the semi-frozen surface of Loch Muick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323908586"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5207/5323908586_524ca81075_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323924008"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5283/5323924008_b935957905_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323927658"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5208/5323927658_5c95ae57b6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't however stay long on the summit to enjoy the views. The wind was biting and so we dropped off to the east, heading back into the trees and moving towards one of the many roads which criss-cross the woods around Prince Charle's house at Birkhall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323934788"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5285/5323934788_ec3ec6816d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323340825"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5008/5323340825_ba5a7f912d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We paused briefly in the still woods to have a bite of lunch but the penetrating cold made it a relatively swift affair. Soon we were off, referring often to the map to pick our way through the maze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323949258"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5246/5323949258_4bd4574c2e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk out, sheltered from the wind, was pleasant and from time to time the forest abated to give views up onto the summits we had traversed earlier, and across to Morven and Ballater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323347703"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5046/5323347703_8d9d1ce204_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5323351125"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5089/5323351125_519049fa11_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stretch of track in the woods above Loch Ullachie was particularly icy and a couple of people took minor tumbles. Luckily we reached the security of the road before any major injuries had been had. It was then a simple matter of dropping down the road to the cars and a quick drive back to the fireside, beer and crisps in the pub in Ballater.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Buck of Cabrach</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/11/2010-11-14-the-buck-of-cabrach/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-14T21:21:33+00:00</published><updated>2010-11-14T21:21:33+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-11-14:/blog/2010/11/2010-11-14-the-buck-of-cabrach/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags:

&lt;p&gt;It was dark and cold on the bus but nevertheless, just after 7am on a Sunday morning, there were 29 determined Stockets heading out for a short day in the hills of the Cabrach. Through the back roads we twisted and turned our way until we were deposited by the side of the Lumsden road under gloomy grey skies.&lt;/p&gt;

Through the back roads we twisted and turned our way until we were deposited by the side of the Lumsden road under gloomy grey skies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The bitter cold got everyone moving quickly and we were soon labouring our way through bog and marsh up the lower north-eastern slopes of The Buck.  The line of fenceposts we made for offered little in the way of firm ground but eventually a muddy track did appear. At around 500m, as the clouds enveloped us, we climbed above the snowline. As the ground underfoot hardened the going became much easier and we were soon peering in front to find the summit. We paused briefly just short of the trig point to let people catch up before crossing the final few metres to the jumbled summit area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5175607203"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5175607203_febc00ab52_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snow-swept rocks of the summit were scrambled over and up to reach the trig pillar. The Buck stands at 720m and is classified as a Graham. As we arrived the swirling clouds were blown away by a freshening wind. We enjoyed excellent views across Aberdeenshire and further west to where the higher mountains were still shrouded by cloud. Further investigation revealed the &lt;a href="http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/17252/details/the+buck/"&gt;stone carvings&lt;/a&gt; which this hill is known for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sheltered western side we paused for our first break of the day where hot drinks revived cold bodies. After this we commenced our long winding trek south-west along the boundary which separates Moray and Aberdeenshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5175682785"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5175682785_6245341bb2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first part, the descent to Kebbuck Knowe we had views with blue skies above. However, after visiting the delightfully named Hill of Snowy Slack, we turned and crossed a high bealach to climb towards Mount Midden where cloud was streaming up from the glen and blowing over the tops. After this we were wreathed in cloud again and snowflakes began to fall, gentle at first but becoming more serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5176326740"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5176326740_c223cf5087_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5175728817"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5175728817_5888368911_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 11am we paused close to the summit of Mount Midden to observe two minutes silence. With the snowflakes falling onto frozen marsh and the sudden silence cold and oppressive it was a sombre and fitting place to remember the great sacrifice that was made so that we can enjoy our continued freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5175790803"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4108/5175790803_788674c5e4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We continued on, heading now almost due south along the boundary line, circumventing peat hags and semi-frozen pools until we came to the flat summit of Creag nan Euan and dropped down to a boundary post. Here the fence post swung away but we kept our course, descending besides a new electrified fence until we picked up the landrover track at around 387187.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5176413226"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5176413226_075ce8cfa8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track we now followed all the way as it dropped us below the snowline and finally out of the cloud, all the way down into Glenbuchat. The pace quickened with a good track beneath our feet and there wasn't another pause until we stopped just above the farm of Blackhillock in the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5176418950"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4088/5176418950_4ae419a33c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we followed a slightly overgrown and muddy track that took us to a gate and a final field crossing to reach the road at Easterbuchat. It was then a simple matter of walking down the road to meet the coach at the junction with the Strathdon Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our initial attempts to find a watering hole were thwarted but we eventually found refuge in the Haughton Arms in Alford. A couple of pints were enjoyed in warm surroundings before the Cults Hillwalking Club showed up and we made a strategic withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The West Glenshee Hills</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/10/the-west-glenshee-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-16T22:06:23+01:00</published><updated>2010-10-16T22:06:23+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-10-16:/blog/2010/10/the-west-glenshee-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 20.98 km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just after 7am we rolled out of Aberdeen, heading along besides the River Dee with 21 Stockets on board. I was helping out today so was up and down the bus for the first part of the journey, collecting money and then talking people through the day's proposed route. At Ballater we stopped to pick up the club's President, and fuelled up with delicious pies and hot coffee at the bakers (second breakfast). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was grey and cold at Ballater but as we moved further inland occasional breaks could be seen and there was blue sky over the Cairngorms as we passed through Braemar towards our dropping off point below the Pass of Glenshee at Baddoch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089227911"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5089227911_94283ea2fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under sombre skies, and with limited room by the side of the A93, we were quickly kitted up and moving down the vehicle track which runs alongside the Baddoch burn. As we approached the farm building at Baddoch itself we turned away from the track, climbing a hillside that was at first steep and grassy but soon had us up on to the long northern ridge of Carn Aosda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089240717"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5089240717_20e2f2d0aa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089847860"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4151/5089847860_2a29157032_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially a muddy track was followed up to Carn Chrionaidh where we saw a herd of deer with accompanying stag on the skyline. Up until that point we had heard their bellows echoing along the sinuous line of the Baddoch. After this though the ridge became a delight, a short and springy carpet of clipped heather with a winding track that climbed delightfully above the Dubh-Coire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089849630"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4147/5089849630_7abf8e9e18_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089890338"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4152/5089890338_b1642fc534_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089278011"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/5089278011_e97027dc8a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across to the east the tops beyond the A93 road were shrouded in a gloomy cloud. We too were climbing into it as we approached the quartzite slopes below Carn Aosda. After a short descent we climbed up the coire that separates the eastern and western tops of the first Munro of the day. With very little effort we were at the summit cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089945130"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4144/5089945130_d76b15317e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089357869"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4112/5089357869_3d17157c23_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn't much of a view to speak of as we munched on elevenses and so we were pretty soon heading back along the track, picking up the route which skirts around the top of Butchart's Coire. Occasionally the ski centre paraphernalia loomed eerily out of the mist. Fortunately the signs were promising as in front of us dark shapes slowly resolved themselves into our route ahead. Loch Vrotachan was particularly still as we passed it to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089365993"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4092/5089365993_a662c679b4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089370025"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5089370025_b9aea4ee14_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089975956"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4149/5089975956_579b0b0acb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a few minutes later we climbed up the track that, along with power and communications cables, runs up to the summit of The Cairnwell, our second Munro of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089474317"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4127/5089474317_ec3d9e704d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089484795"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5089484795_ce053802b5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089490527"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5089490527_94a1b78b2e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top of The Cairnwell is strewn with rocks, cairns, buildings and masts and is really quite a mess. Luckily it was possible to continue a short way to the south to escape much of it and gaze down the long stretch of Gleann Beag which drops down from the pass to the Spittal of Glenshee, our final destination for the day. There were showers grazing distant hilltops but everything was definitely getting clearer despite the unnerving lack of wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089522159"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4106/5089522159_59c3d5c19e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5089533045"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5089533045_452604634e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then retraced our upward steps back to a branching path that headed away from Butchart's Coire to join the long, meandering ridge that connects The Cairnwell and Carn Aosda to Carn nan Sac, a subsidiary peak of the third Munro of the day, Carn a' Gheoidh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090195566"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4083/5090195566_6647a7d32b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090052601"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5090052601_b88a374143_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part was one of the most enjoyable sections of the hike. As the clouds began to properly clear, the landscape was slowly revealed, peaks resolving out of shades of grey and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5091095438"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4132/5091095438_747d2d9902_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the east the sunlight was breaking through, casting spectacular rays onto the glen and mountains beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090700884"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5090700884_977a66e1d6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way around the ridge to the summit of Carn nan Sac. This has a number of cairns but we chose the most easterly of them to stop for lunch. This afforded fine views out to the south and the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090504401"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4128/5090504401_46eaff8a0e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a gentle amble along the wide, grassy plateau to the final climb up to the summit of Carn a' Gheoidh. By this time there were flecks of blue sky to be seen and the visibility was superb. The nearer hills in the Glas Tulaichean group were easy to pick out, and beyond them the three humpbacks of Beinn a' Ghlo could be seen. Even further away was the distinctive shape of Schiehallion. To the west we could see Lochnagar, Carn of Claise, Carn an Tuirc, Glas Maol and Creag Leachach with the hills above Blair Atholl, including Mount Blair, visible to the southeast. To the north the Cairngorms were being picked out by bright afternoon sunshine, all the way around from Cairn Toul to Ben Avon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending a fair few minutes enjoying this marvellous panorama, helped by the fact that the wind was very light and the sun was shining, we dropped off the south side of Carn a' Gheoidh to continue our north-south traverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090805861"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4145/5090805861_87988f33b2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mountains long, broad southern ridge extends across a number of lumpy summits until it meets the Corbett of Ben Gulabin. Recent stalking activities have brought a vehicle track much of the way up this ridge and it was this that we followed back down, enjoying the views of the hills around Dalmunzie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5091429768"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5091429768_1193a43c70_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We passed the track that leads up to the summit of Ben Gulabin but the thought of a pint or two at the Spittal hotel was too much and we were drawn onwards, dropping down the track to meet the A93 just a couple of km short of the Spittal. We then had to pick our way along the road, avoiding the tarmac as much as possible and enjoying a last view back up Glen Shee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5090861059"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4089/5090861059_148e600daf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the hotel at the very civilised hour of 3:30 and were able to while away a good couple of pints in the bar where a roaring fire kept everything cosy. It was then back on the coach for the ride back to Aberdeen. Another excellent and enjoyable Stocket walk was completed - next month we climb the Buck of Cabrach and a completely new hillwalking area for me.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Creag Meagaidh</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/10/creag-meagaidh/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-10T22:28:32+01:00</published><updated>2010-10-10T22:28:32+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-10-10:/blog/2010/10/creag-meagaidh/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 23.77 km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn has definitely been making its presence felt in the east of
Scotland with wind and rain blowing through constantly during the past
week. Meanwhile, over in the west there had been reports of high
pressure and clear, though windy, conditions. With a good forecast for
Sunday (and after missing my alarm on Saturday) I was up early and
speeding across towards the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn has definitely been making its presence felt in the east of

week. Meanwhile, over in the west there had been reports of high
pressure and clear, though windy, conditions. With a good forecast for
Sunday (and after missing my alarm on Saturday) I was up early and
speeding across towards the west.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The MWIS forecast suggested there would be a weather split around the
line of the A9, so today I chose to do a circuit of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creag_Meagaidh"&gt;Creag
Meagaidh&lt;/a&gt; which lies to the
north of the road between Aviemore and Spean Bridge. There were high
winds forecast and so I chose to do the round in an anti-clockwise
direction, keeping the easterly wind to my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072214647" title="View 'Welcome Sign' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4105/5072214647_f9d17dbba5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the large public car park at Aberarder which I arrived at just after
10am, there was definitely a strong wind blowing and it felt cold. This
was despite the best efforts of the sun which was starting to break out
through the fast moving clouds. Looking at the conditions I decided to
take the winter jacket and was later very glad of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jacket wasn’t needed at first though. Once kitted up I set off up
the well built track which passes the large house and then winds its way
gently up, passing through sparse woodland; the russets and golds on
display in the glen here were beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072279877" title="View 'The climb up from Loch Laggan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4085/5072279877_5325f82268_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a small cairn I took a smaller track which branched off uphill and to
the right. This track was reasonably good to begin with as it climbed up
through the trees, but rapidly descended into a boggy ribbon as the
vegetation thinned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072338339" title="View 'img width="&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5072338339_51bdc918fa_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the views that were starting to open out, both ahead and behind,
were sufficient to take my mind off the undesirable conditions
underfoot. Behind me rays of sunlight were bursting out of thinning
cloud to touch the waters of Loch Laggan, whilst to my left I could see
deeper into Coire Ardair, the great Coire around which the peaks of
Creag Meagaidh sit watchfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072890254" title="View 'Light over Laggan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4125/5072890254_c7b5c5a101_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just below the low summit of Cnap Cnapanan, the bog finally relented and
the path became excellent. This relatively low jumble of crags was
bypassed around its north side, giving excellent views down Loch Laggan,
and then the final push up Carn Liath began. The track continued until
the final summit boulder field where it was lost amongst the hard,
featureless ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072355557" title="View 'Coire Ardair' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4150/5072355557_8141147607_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, as I had climbed I had entered into the cloud which was
stubbornly sitting at around 975m. It was being whipped up by the strong
easterly wind that now hit me with its full force as I staggered east,
making my way from one cairn to the next until I came to the big cairn
marking the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5073013366" title="View 'Summit of Carn Liath' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5073013366_a77f0c2586_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very glad of the windbreak in the lee side of the cairn and sat
down to have a brew and a snack. Away north, towards Garva bridge and
the glen containing the young Spey, there was blue sky beginning to
break through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5073027264" title="View 'A change in the weather' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5073027264_987c6bf060_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of ten minutes the views improved dramatically and by
the time I had stopped to have a look at the “gate to nowhere” and then
returned past the cairn to pick up the main track west, there was
definite signs of an improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5073021282" title="View 'A gate to nowhere' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4153/5073021282_aa56c7a167_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying on down from the summit of Carn Liath I was soon bathed in
sunshine. Sheltered from the wind by the bulk of Carn Liath it was
wonderfully warm, swiftly bringing life back to my cold fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072469253" title="View 'img width="&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5072469253_a6b9f9192c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Carn Liath to the next Munro, Stob Poite Coire Ardair, there is a
gentle rolling walk along an undulating ridge that takes in a number of
smaller summits. As I advanced along it the views continued to improve,
the cloud being teased away from the summits in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072481107" title="View 'Loch Laggan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4103/5072481107_1a6164b2c7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track led along the crest of the ridge and here I once again
encountered the wind which was now thankfully (or else because of my
excellent route planning!) behind me. I paused often to peer down into
the coire and take photos looking along towards the cliffs. In the
distance I could now see the fabled Window, the one weakness in Coire
Ardair’s otherwise impenetrable defences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072469253" title="View 'First view of the Window' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4087/5072469253_a6b9f9192c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally after crossing a subsidiary top the ridge curves around to the
left up to the second Munro of the day, Stob Poite Coire Ardair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5073192058" title="View 'The ridge leading to Stob Poite Coire Ardair' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5073192058_c975bb350f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072605735" title="View 'Light hitting the floor of Coire Ardair' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4104/5072605735_617c6d9d5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the approach to the east this is a shapely mountain with riven
gulleys in its facing side. Once you are on top though it is a fairly
flat plateau which runs some distance towards the west end where the
summit cairn is to be found. Luckily, though the terrain lacked
interest, the views down into Coire Ardair were spectacular. Each time I
went over to have a look the lighting had changed, breaks in the cloud
sending rays down to hit the valley floor and push rippling patterns
across the hidden lochan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5071860119" title="View 'A magical moment' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4130/5071860119_3e84d9be04_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views back to Carn Liath were also improving with the increasing
sunshine. Eventually I tore myself away to briefly visit the summit
cairn. It was so windy though that I barely spent more than a minute
there before heading off the west and dropping down on a good path to
the shelter of the Window, a wide col above the narrow defile which
drops rapidly down into Coire Ardair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5072829915" title="View 'Coire Ardair and Loch Laggan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4126/5072829915_87c8a8b757_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main plateau of Creag Meagaidh itself had by now cleared almost
entirely of cloud and as the final layer was peeled away the summit
could be seen, complete with a couple of tiny figures silhouetted
against the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5073487344" title="View 'Cloud clears from Creag Meagaidh' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4110/5073487344_ec0cacb592_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Window I paused to take advantage of the shelter offered by the
close set walls and in the sunshine enjoyed a lunch, looking away across
the wild and desolate hills that sit to the east of the Great Glen above
the infant waters of the Spey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075107378" title="View 'The Window' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4060/5075107378_b41252fca3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was sitting contemplating the view, I noticed running up from the
far end of the nearby Lochan Uaine, what appeared to be a ridgeline that
rose neatly up to almost the summit of Creag Meagaidh. I got the map out
and studied the contours and found that it was a ramp-like corrie that
should make a good route up. Going this way would avoid me retracing my
steps as I had already made my mind up to descend by the Window and
visit Coire Ardair itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075113400" title="View 'Approaching the Green Lochan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/5075113400_2a0e6cd10a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch I packed up and left the baggers path which heads up the
slope to the south of the Window. I skirted along slightly bouldery and
boggy ground to the north of the Green Lochan. At the far end I found a
jumble of boulders that I climbed which brought me along a grass rake to
the foot of the corrie itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5074521477" title="View 'The Green Lochan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4008/5074521477_c568d2de89_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately I found a faint track which led upwards. I lost it
occasionally amongst crags and rocks but then picked it up again higher
up. In almost no time I emerged on the plateau of Creag Meagaidh itself
with just the final pull up the summit to complete. I was there in
no-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075141606" title="View 'The final slope to the summit of Creag Meagaidh' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4131/5075141606_f1f6f1dbee_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views from the summit were simply sublime. A haze pervaded the view
and thick clouds were rolling up against distant peaks. The quality of
light was almost surreal, the haze turning the sky grey on the horizon
but leaving it a clear and crystalline deep blue above. I moved slightly
away from the summit to sit and take in the views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075874189" title="View 'The Loch Treig Hills' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/5075874189_2960f71b32_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I retreated back to the summit cairn to enjoy a final brew
whilst staying sheltered from the wind. Then it was back down the way
I’d come, but this time continuing across the plateau to take a look at
Mad Meg’s Cairn, a huge structure below which was reportedly buried the
body of a young girl who committed suicide but was refused a burial in
the local kirkyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075883885" title="View 'Mad Meg's cairn' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/5075883885_39940cc3c9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this I headed eastwards to peer over the edge of the cliffs into
Coire Ardair itself. The view from this end was very dramatic with the
late afternoon sunshine lighting the far side of the coire whilst the
lochan was lost in shadow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5076488784" title="View 'The cliffs above Coire Ardair' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/5076488784_620a62d999_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075907967" title="View 'The north ridge of Creag Meagaidh' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4046/5075907967_4d28a2fd41_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I then followed the clear track back down to the Window. I
didn’t stay too long at the col but now took the path that dropped into
the Window itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the col the initial descent is very steep down a cascade of
boulders which are damp and cold in their sheltered eastern position.
After some time of making only slow progress I finally reached a line of
grass that descended down the side of the boulders, a faint track
zig-zagging its way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5075921185" title="View 'The Window' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4019/5075921185_4d116337a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final clamber across the bottom of the boulders got me onto a good
track that now made its way to the shores of the lochan. The views up
onto the cliffs were breathtaking. Slightly further down the coire two
stags were bellowing, their cries low and mournful but echoing strangely
off the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5076533398" title="View 'Puist Coire Ardair' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4047/5076533398_ff2a3a73e4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat for a moment munching on a final bar of chocolate and looking over
the quiet waters of the lochan, the dark cliffs standing solemnly
behind. This is definitely a place I want to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5076576816" title="View 'img width="&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4063/5076576816_1670ecafa2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this there was no problem with routefinding. An excellent track
runs the length of the coire, from the lochan back to Aberader. Once
away from the cliffs I was back in the golden afternoon sunshine and got
to enjoy a wonderfully peaceful walk back, breathing in the views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer to Loch Laggan you pass through a few stands of beech trees and
these were stunning, illuminated by the sun. Unfortunately my SLR
battery died at this point so I was left with my phone camera to capture
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, around an hour or so after leaving the lochan I arrived back
at the car park, the sun starting to sink below the hills and a chill
creeping into the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After packing up and changing shoes I started the long drive back to
Aberdeen, pausing a couple of times initially to photograph the stunning
sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a great day with conditions improving all the time and the
consistent haze bringing a dramatic aspect to the light.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Jock's Road</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/08/jocks-road/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-21T22:01:40+01:00</published><updated>2010-08-21T22:01:40+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-08-21:/blog/2010/08/jocks-road/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 26 km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With twenty-one Stockets aboard the bus (after pick-ups at the Bridge of Dee and at Stonehaven) we made our way down the A90 to Glen Clova. Initial sunshine in Aberdeenshire soon gave way to less pleasant conditions into Angus with dark clouds sitting ominously over the hills and glens. After a break at Stracathro services we made our way through Kirriemuir and then out onto the narrow road to Clova. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With a coach it was slow going, particularly as half the glen seemed to be on its way out for the day. We disturbed several broods of partridges and were held up briefly by a herd of cattle, including one old but extremely large bull, that were being moved by a determined looking farmerâ€™s wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4915314579"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4915314579_b22b1a7112_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4915316771"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4915316771_ffc560a6f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around ten when we pulled up at the small quarry just before the car park in Glen Doll. There was low cloud over the nearby hills and a light drizzle was falling. Without much hesitation we were on our way, heading down the final stretch of road, past the car park, and then out on the first stretch of Jockâ€™s Road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after this we met a helpful Forestry Sign that said, â€œJockâ€™s Road Closedâ€. Luckily it turned out not to apply to the whole road, just a short stretch through the plantation. Thankfully we were able to bypass this by following a well signed diversion on the south bank of the White Water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916301545"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4916301545_f71171ecf5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point a reasonably heavy rain was falling, but the trees kept us sheltered and it was a relaxing way to start the walk. The White Water chattered below us as we wound our way steadily up the glen. As we progressed scraps of blue sky began to appear above us and as we crossed the river to rejoin the main path we were in sunshine with the summits clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916915596"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4916915596_f6dbe47ae6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief break we tackled the main climb of the day: following Jockâ€™s Road out of the head of Glen Doll. Some significant work has been done in the past on this track and it is of excellent quality, climbing to the right of the more precipitous cliffs below Craig Maud. It gave great views back down the glen and on to the heather clad slopes. As we climbed the clouds rolled back in and we were back under grey skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916335507"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4080/4916335507_1e753350e1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the summit of the path we paused again, exploring Daveyâ€™s Howff and the memorial plaque to the five experienced hillwalkers who had died in tragic and mysterious circumstances on a crossing of Jockâ€™s Road just after New Year in 1959.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916382089"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4077/4916382089_78e879c1a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916388147"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4916388147_8249b8a1d7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there were still dark clouds about, the conditions seemed to be getting better. However, as we came out of the shelter of the glen we were quickly exposed to the high winds that had been confidently predicted by various weather services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916428985"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4916428985_bf710486f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916452271"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4916452271_76b35b0e20_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the tops the excellent path dwindles somewhat until it became more of a muddy track, winding its way with less certainty along the course of the allt that flows back down towards Glen Doll. We followed this course for some time as the Munros of Tom Buidhe and Tolmount came in to view at the head of the stream. It became clear however that we had missed a turning and that Jock's Road now lay some way above us, climbing the long ridge to Crow Craigies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916439995"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4916439995_1c191f85f6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We climbed up the steep slopes to regain the track and then followed this until we got to the crags of Crow Craigies and the highest point of Jock's Road. It was here, with views north and east to the Deeside Hills, as well as the much closer White Mounth Munros, including Broad Cairn and Lochnagar, that we paused for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916444061"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4916444061_477062a5da_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we dropped back to the allt, crossed it by a convenient set of stones and then struck a course south and west up the slightly steeper eastern side of Tom Buidhe. As we climbed we could look back east to the Glen Doll hills which were still sitting under a heavy covering of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917077876"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4917077876_58b841b298_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916452271"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4916452271_76b35b0e20_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we came out on to the summit of Tom Buidhe we were hit by the full force of the wind. Still, its presence had almost completely blown away the clouds and there were magnificent views in all directions. In the west was the dark mass of Glas Maol and the Glen Shee hills. Closer at hand was the Tolmount and the hills above Glen Callater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917085856"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4917085856_5c541641b1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916491589"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4916491589_a2ae580e22_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917101442"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4917101442_3f6939b217_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the north could be seen the high Cairngorms, from the cliffs of Braeriach to the granite tors on Beinn Mheadhoin. Looking south we could see the Perthshire hills retreating into a hazy distance. It was wonderful, despite the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917117578"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4917117578_4c29db4470_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917120536"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4917120536_5312fe3b70_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Tom Buidhe we took the obvious track around the lip of the gentle corrie and followed it along to the summit of the neighbouring Munro, Tolmount. Now the wind was on our backs and propelled us easily up the last rocky climb to the cairn. We paused again at the top to admire the views. A few other people joined us and it was possible to see plenty of other figures out in the Munro-filled part of the world. Once at the summit it is important to continue slightly north to get the view of Loch Callater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917139338"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4917139338_7400b1239d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916568349"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4916568349_e3c7d3939a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tolmount was the name of Jock's Road in the days when it was a drover's road across the hills. From the summit of the mountain we dropped back down to pick up the road itself as it descended steeply into Glen Callater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916579029"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4916579029_b07dbbdf5e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4916983317"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4916983317_c59eef5ef3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track is very vague at this point and it took a good bit of descending down steep, grassy slopes before we met anything at all well defined. There were fine views all around as we made our way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917598520"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4917598520_74ef15058b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917003159"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4917003159_298090280e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917611538"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4917611538_c8586a2990_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as the gradient eased, we joined a well constructed track that followed the course of the Allt an Loch, a chattering burn that quickly grew in size as it wound its way through Glen Callater. The head if the glen is spectacular with the Tolmount dominating the centre alongside the hills further west which surround Loch Kander. These all look spectacular as they caught the afternoon light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917114359"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4078/4917114359_e617357253_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917054667"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4102/4917054667_30ee7848f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917749572"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4917749572_a694bbf25d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road took a rollercoaster route of ups and downs as the river turned across the undulating valley floor. Sometimes the marshier sections were crossed by stretches of stepping stones. Eventually though the sides of the glen receded and the land flattened out into pools and reedy beds with the river now more languorous as it drifted into Loch Callater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917756964"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4123/4917756964_341f67505f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917796554"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4917796554_c0f1900d3b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917761402"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4137/4917761402_b99d2ab2c5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track followed the eastern shore of the loch and continued to be excellent. There was now dramatic clouds pouring in from the south west. Occasional gaps would let sunshine in, lighting up the foreground vividly whilst the hills in the background remained dark and sombre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917209615"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4917209615_caa36d50b0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, as the sun once again came out, we came to the lodge at the far end of the loch. A bothy next door provided ample bench seating for a last snack stop and a contemplation of the views back down the loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4917246347"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4917246347_6b3b149dd4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a simple case of following the land rover track down through the wild Glen Callater. Although the clouds returned and threatened rain we remained dry until we reached the pick up point at Auchallater beneath the dark heather-clad slopes of Morrone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coach took us back to Aberdeen by way of a couple of pints in the Fife Arms in Braemar. At first it was busy but soon the 6pm rush subsided and we all got served and found a seat. It was a tired group that headed back to the city but it had been a great day, made better by the fact that we had avoided most of the rain and got some wonderful views from these wild and isolated hills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Bynack More and Cairn Gorm</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/08/bynack-more-and-cairn-gorm/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-15T22:37:28+01:00</published><updated>2010-08-15T22:37:28+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-08-15:/blog/2010/08/bynack-more-and-cairn-gorm/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 28.8 km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like interminable weekends of rain, wind and general
unpleasantness, yesterday’s weather was warm and sunny and so in the
evening I quickly made plans to head into the mountains today. The
weather forecast was particularly promising for the eastern side of the
country so I checked out what I had still to climb amongst the Munros of
the Cairngorms (quite a few in fact) and then checked out a couple of
possible routes. With long summer days still around I decided that a
route taking in both the out-of-the-way Bynack More, and the eponymous
Cairn Gorm would work out well and saw that there was a track that cut
down from the ski centre towards the Ryvoan pass allowing me to complete
a satisying loop of the two. Soon after my bag was packed and I was
ready for an early departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning lived up to its bright promise, with unbroken blue skies
above me as I drove out of Aberdeen. There was some cloud around as I
passed over to Strathdon and from the viewing point past Corgarff I
could see that the higher Cairngorms were holding on to a cap of clouds.
No matter though as the forecast had promised improved conditions into
the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4921023580" title="View 'West towards the Cairngorms' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4921023580_3d5a4b7e28_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drove along the quiet backroad through Nethy Bridge, along to
Coylumbridge and then hit the tourist traffic on the main road up to the
Cairn Gorm ski centre. Small sailing boats were already plying the still
blue waters of Loch Morlich as I passed by it before the road climbed up
to the lower ski centre car park. There were a few people up here
admiring the view back down over Glen More, but no-one else was booting
up for a walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4920491661" title="View 'Loch Morlich in Glen More' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4920491661_a62b7f42ef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undeterred I made my preparations, only to discover that both sets of
batteries for my GPS were virtually dead. It wasn’t that I was worried
about navigation. I had a map and compass. I was worried about the loss
of my track and the associated statistics (how sad!). Luckily, my phone
came to the rescue and I soon had &lt;a href="http://mytracks.appspot.com/"&gt;My
Tracks&lt;/a&gt; up and running and recording a GPS
track for me (no data loss, hurrah!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4898398722" title="View 'Looking over Glen More' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4898398722_da1ac7f948_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the ski centre car park I dropped down to the Allt Na Ciste,
crossing it and turning to follow the track on its east bank. SOon after
this a track forked off to the right and I followed this as it wound its
way across gently rolling, heather clad land across to Lochan na Beinne
which was beautifully still in the morning air. At just after 10am it
was already a very hot day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4897993411" title="View 'Still Life' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4897993411_c613a15f5c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Lochan the track followed a boggy course below the lower slopes
of Stac na h-lolaire. At some point I deviated away from the line of the
track marked on the OS Map, though I was still on a clear route. This
kept me above the wooded gully which I imagine would have been very
boggy. Unfortunately the track I was on finally bent around to the west
but petered out in a further gully where a reedy burn soaked both my
feet. I continued along it as it went into the deeper section of woods
and although I must have crossed it at some point, missed the track.
Instead I broke through waist-high ferns to reach another gully which
had been largely cleared of trees. Although it was steep I was able to
pick my way carefully down it. In the shelter of the gully though it was
hot, damp and very fly-infested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad, some time later, to reach the floor of Glen More where I
immediately hit the excellent path that comes up from Glenmore Lodge.
The going was much easier now and I soon arrived at the branch down to
An Lochan Uaine (the green lochan) which I headed down to. No pictures
can do justice to the incredible beauty of this piece of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4905167787" title="View 'The Green Lochan' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4905167787_5ddf459b8e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the shelter of both hills and thinning pine trees it more than lives
up to its name, its glass-like surface mirroring the scenery. I sat by
the water munching on a cereal bar and enjoying the tranquility of this
idyllic spot. A few other walkers came down to explore its banks and so
I eventually moved on, returning back to the track which now heads
towards the Ryvoan Bothy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4906984470" title="View 'Joining the Lairig an Laoigh track' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/4906984470_11a1abf80a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the bothy a Scottish RIghts of Way Society sign points a
fork in the road. I took the right fork to Braemar as this path
eventually leads to the Lairig an Laoigh, one of the passes through the
high Cairngorms. The track is of excellent quality and in short order I
was at the wide opening of Strath Nethy, crossing the River Nethy by a
good quality footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4906408921" title="View 'The River Nethy' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4082/4906408921_5e84011b1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the far side the track branched off to the left to climb the long,
gentle shoulder of An Lurg, a bump in the high, laregely featureless
plataue whose high point is the summit of Bynack More.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4906411037" title="View 'Strath Nethy' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4101/4906411037_ee0d3acc12_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 780m the main Lairig track is left as it turns to the east to
contour around Bynack More and the Munro baggers track continues almost
due south, passing over the 818m spot height from which you get your
first true look at Bynack More sitting to the left of its smaller
neighbour, Bynack Beg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4907943947" title="View 'Bynack More and Bynack Beg' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4142/4907943947_9076562890_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4922247261" title="View 'Bynack More and Bynack Beg' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4120/4922247261_4d64d98f87_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path heads up the north ridge, very steeply at first but then
flattening off slightly as it turns to the west side of the ridge to
avoid the rocky crest. Rather than follow the track I stuck to the crest
as much as posible, enjoying scrambling up the grippy granite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4922253717" title="View 'Approaching the summit' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4922253717_365838beef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I overtook a couple of folk toiling up the path and soon after that
emerged amongst the summit boulders, the cairn some way to my south.
Beyond it the sharp profile of Coire Sputan Dearg on Ben Macdui and the
tors on Beinn Mheadhoin had come into view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4922265653" title="View 'The north ridge of Bynack More' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4122/4922265653_ae7445ce25_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed by way of the large summit cairn, taking in the fantastic
panorama that had opened up all around me. To the west Cairn Gorm had
blown off its early cloud and now stoody dominating the immedaite scene.
To the south the pass of the Lairig an Laigh could be seen, the various
pools and lochans in it catching the high sun. To the south and east the
long sloping sides of Beinn a’ Bhiuird and Ben Avon with its Tors showed
off their bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4923341534" title="View 'Ben Avon and Beinn a' Bhuird beyond the Barns' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4075/4923341534_3ddf05c471_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat up here for almost half an hour, munching on a sandwich or two and
taking in the views under sunny skies. There was only the lightest of
breezes and so a few insects had gathered up near the cairn which were
somewhat irksome. I had a chat with chap who had been out walking and
camping in the hills for almost a week. He had come through rain and
high winds but had enjoyed the weekend sunshine and was now prepared for
one last night, camped up on Bynack More, before heading back to
civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4923316060" title="View 'Ben Rinnes from Bynack More' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4923316060_663efcc0d6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my lunch I dropped south from the summit to continue my loop.
First of all my route took me down by the Barns of Bynack, a set of
granite tors which sit just south of the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4923342756" title="View 'The Barns of Bynack' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4123/4923342756_9eaf84e0e6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Barns I dropped down and made my way slightly west to climb
the unremarkable A’ Choinneach. This 1017m high bump is a Munro top but
the legs hardly feel it and I only stopped briefly at the cairn to
admire the view back to Bynack More before continuing on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4932886263" title="View 'Summit of A' Choinneach' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4134/4932886263_d5aa3c2534_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was drawn by knowledge that the next view was one I had long sought:
that of Loch Avon, the body of water truly at the heart of the
Cairngorms. It’s dark green surface shimmers below the steep cliffs that
make up Ben Macdui, Derry Cairngorm, Cairn Gorm and Beinn Mheadhoin, all
Munros. I detoured out to a slight promontory whcih gave a fantastic
view down the loch. Here I paused for another twenty or so minutes just
enjoying the splendour of this wild and remote spot. I was already
mentally noting a number of potential campsites that I’d like to use on
a trip through these mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4932904323" title="View 'Loch Avon' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4932904323_1390e74c05_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my break I rejoined the main track which winds down off A’
Choinneach, past several small pools with Cairn Gorm behind them, and
down to the Saddle which marks the head of Strath Nethy. In poor weather
this would provide a good escape route at this point but with the sun
beating down I was ready to climb up to my second Munro of the day,
Cairn Gorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4932923051" title="View 'Cairn Gorm' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4932923051_bfe954d687_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good track climbs up the right of the high cliffs which guard the
summit of Cairn Gorm. It takes you up alongside Strath Nethy giving good
views back to Bynack More and the eastern hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t the most direct of paths but does take you up a moderate slope
that soon gains height. Eventually the path turned westward, following
the course of a burn that came down from some of the last lingering snow
patches of the year. Here I found a determined skier, repeatedly sliding
down the short runs of hardened snow. They seemed to be enjoying
themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the path was now heading for the Ptarmigan so I turned off it
and struck up the final slopes, emerging on the Cairn Gorm plateau just
a few hundred metres away from the summit and the weather station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4933572018" title="View 'Cairn Gorm summit' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4933572018_3dae734f74_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way over to the weather station and then dropped slightly down
the bouldery slope to get the view south to hidden Loch Etchachan and
Ben Macdui. In the afternoon light it was a wonderful view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4933579920" title="View 'Loch Etchachan from Cairn Gorm' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4139/4933579920_3a6a06fa1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4932992603" title="View 'Beinn Mheadhoin from Cairn Gorm' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4096/4932992603_87b6cbc23e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pause here I returned to the summit to tag the cairn and check
out the view west across Loch Morlich and beyond to where the Moray
Firth would lie hidden in haze. It was then an easy walk on the well
made track north along the plateau, passing the Maquis Well and soon
encountering the ski equipment which make this mountain synonymous with
Scottish winter sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4933019797" title="View 'Summit of Cairn Gorm' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4933019797_170d689342_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the built up area and kept away from the Ptarmigan (where the
funicular railway terminates), taking an offtrack route across the
rolling plateau until I dropped down into Coire na Ciste. This steep
gulley would lead me directly to the car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4933026219" title="View 'The path off Cairn Gorm' on Flickr.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4075/4933026219_8029726a02_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was steep, unsteady ground but after some uncertainty I
picked up a track lower down that soon became clear and well
constructed. It skirted round and final outlier of Cairn Gorm and then
descended to the car park and my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick change out of my boots and a phone call home I was heading
back, stopping briefly by Loch Morlich to get the view of the mountains
that had been cloud covered earlier in the day. I stopped once more
above Abernethy to get a final photo and then made the long drive back
across the mountains to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At half-past six in the evening and with a boot full of gear I headed out of Aberdeen towards the sunny west. There were clouds about but the sun was shining and the air was warm as I drove through Braemar and out along the road to the Linn of Dee. The sunshine over the Dee was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

There were clouds about but the sun was shining and the air was warm as I drove through Braemar and out along the road to the Linn of Dee. The sunshine over the Dee was beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At just on 8:15pm I was booted up and heading into the woods away from the car park. It was my latest start for a hike but there was still plenty of light and I decided I could walk for about two hours before I would need to start looking about for a place to pitch the tent. This was going to be my first wild camp so I wanted to ensure I had sufficient light to get my tent sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4737867119"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4093/4737867119_f3bf0b00cf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk along the Derry Road beside the quiet Lui Water was beautiful. The cloud formations were fantastic and at one point I was treated to a brief sundog. At Derry there was plenty of activity: tents, bikes, camp fires, football games, laughter and shouting. It was a busy place with various camps set up around the river and trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738508056"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4738508056_8655ac69f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Derry I followed the right of way around to Luibeg where I encountered more campers. After getting a brief toe-wetting at the Luibeg steps (to save the detour around to the bridge) I did my only serious ascent of the day, up and around the south shoulder of Carn a' Mhaim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738511100"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4738511100_f97c3d804f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I rounded the corner the Devil's Point came into view, and then behind it the bulk of Cairn Toul. The sky was now darkening as my watch showed the hour ticking over. It was 10pm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738519202"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4116/4738519202_8377de69d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped into the Lairig Ghru and then, as the track headed towards the branch off to Corrour, headed down towards the River Dee to find a site for my tent. On a small flattened knoll, covered in sparse heather I found my spot. It was just up slope from the river but was flat and relatively rock free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738524240"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4141/4738524240_02eae61c60_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to work pitching the tent. Despite it being a while since I had practiced it went up smoothly and soon I had all the various tapes and cords and guys secured. The pitch wasn't perfect but with a calm evening ahead I didn't anticipate any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst setting up the tent the midgies had found me but a cooling breeze got up and drove them away. I set my stove up and made myself a nice hot cup of hot chocolate. With this in hand I watched the light change as the sun sank somewhere beyond Braeriach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4736419720"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4117/4736419720_75eeaf967c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4735241577"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4143/4735241577_a11e9b325f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my first night under canvas in a long, long time I slept fairly well, only waking up a couple of times during the night. Each time I had a peek out of the tent, first seeing the full moon had risen, and later that the north had maintained its cloudy state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 4:30am I finally got up to enjoy the still dawn. The glen was in the shade whilst the mountain tops were beginning to catch the first rays. I wanted to make the most of the clear weather so broke camp and was soon heading along the track to the Corrour branch. A rainbow appeared behind the Devil's Point and a brief shower passed across the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738606326"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4099/4738606326_18bf72e00d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed towards the bothy, crossing the Dee via the metal footbridge. A single tent was outside the bothy but all was quiet. The path continued up into Coire Odhar. With my full pack on I was glad of the good track which rose in a series of zig-zags besides the chattering burn. Behind me the Lairig Ghru was beginning to fill with a suffused light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738638202"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4080/4738638202_aee1d1ddd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bealach I dropped my bag behind a tussock and then, with a spring in my lightened step, headed up to the summit of the Devil's Point. I reached the summit of the day's first Munro just before 6am and had the pleasure of watching the sun light up the surrounding scenery. It was still and beautiful and definitely worth the hassle of lugging a tent around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738030961"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4140/4738030961_3d24025320_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked out Beinn Bhrotain and Monadh Mor above Glen Geusachan. To the south along the line of the Tarf was Beinn a'Ghlo. North I could see along the high ridge to Cairn Toul and away east the sun was rising over Carn a' Mhaim and Ben Macdui. It was simply stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738062681"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4738062681_ac793c8383_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738057703"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4074/4738057703_357a06fc57_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this refreshing wake-up I returned to the bealach and then continued on the track to Cairn Toul. Unfortunately cloud had swept in from the west and soon I was in the mist, picking my way up a boulder field to the subsidiary top. It was then a case of following the ridge around the lip of a coire and ascending the final slope up to Cairn Toul's misty cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738721946"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4094/4738721946_544c8d0940_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no views so I continued on, dropping off Cairn Toul to the col and then ascending the Angel's Peak. As I dropped back down to around 1100m I came out of the mist and got a view of Lochan Uaine and the Lairig Ghru beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738732860"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4098/4738732860_53826b47cf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at the summit of the Angel's Peak, my third Munro of the day, I was once again in the mist. I explored the mountain's north-east ridge and then sat about munching on a cereal bar and enjoying the silence and solemnity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to the bealach below the Devil's Point by a more direct route, contouring below Cairn Toul and then dropping more directly from its southern top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After picking up my bag I dropped down by my route of ascent and once again joined the Lairig Ghru route for the walk out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4738754622"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4097/4738754622_a5c97c7d40_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long road out was a re-run of the previous evenings walk (the misty weather didn't make me want to take the longer Whitebridge route out) but was livened up by walking with the Stocket Hillwalking Club who had done the entire Lairig Ghru over from Coylumbirdge. There were also plenty of other groups of people heading into the Cairngorms, some with massive packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the Linn of Dee there was a barbeque with the Stockets and then a quick drive back to Aberdeen for a good night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Inverey to the Spittal of Glenshee</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/04/2010-04-11-inverey-to-the-spittal-of-glenshee/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-11T23:02:59+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-11T23:02:59+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-04-11:/blog/2010/04/2010-04-11-inverey-to-the-spittal-of-glenshee/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags:

&lt;p&gt;It was a dawn of bright promise over Aberdeen as both members of the Stocket Hillwalking Club and the infamous Cairngorm Club gathered on Mid-Stocket Road for the first 7am start of the season. The preceding days had been warm and sunny and there was optimism for a day free of snow-wading. It didn't turn out quite that way, but certainly the seasons are changing, the snow is finally melting and the heavy layers and crampons have been replaced by a need for wide-brimmed hats and copious amounts of sun cream and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long drive in a creaky coach we set off from Inverey under beautifully blue skies. After 9:30 in the morning there was still a distinct chill in the air and a feel of a lingering frost. We took the standard track that climbs gently up into Glen Ey, marvelling at the views and enjoying the stillness of the early morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4514696481"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2680/4514696481_4898d1bb95_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4515364436/in/set-72157623836928292/"&gt;ruin at Auchelie&lt;/a&gt; and crossing the bridge we took to the open hillside; the steep end of the northern wall of Glen Ey. The short heather made for good progress up a steep slope though the intensity of the sun soon drove off the layers. It was a relief to finally crest the broad, rolling summit. The views were immediately superb. Behind us the giants of the Cairngorms had risen, whilst off to the east we could see the snow-covered slopes of Morrone and the tip of Lochnagar beyond the Stuic buttress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4514774795"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2006/4514774795_7de0bd6101_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wound our way along the series of tops above Glen Ey, first Creag an Lochain and then the twin-summited Carn Creagach. From this vantage point we had a good view onto the corniced north side of Beinn Iutharn Mhor, and beyond it the impressive outline of Beinn a' Ghlo's most northern summit. We also could see the significant drop down to the bealach leading to Carn Bhac. In the end it was less tiresome than it seemed and only a couple of snow slope crossings slowed our progress up to the wide, flat and rocky expanse of the summit of the day's first Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516224992"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2726/4516224992_ff33453ff3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4515610111"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2693/4515610111_9188867ee2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We admired the view over to Ben Macdui, Braeriach and the other high Cairngorms and then dropped off slightly to the west to take a brief rest-stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516267246"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2660/4516267246_4e8bec6ac0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we had to drop south-west of Carn Bhac and negotiate a wide expanse of bog that runs in a series of wide furrels to the north of Beinn Iutharn Mhor. Our plan was to head west of Iutharn Mhor and climb the pass between it and Carn an Righ to reach Glas Tulaichean. The bog was made easier by the lingering snow and we soon gained a drier ridge that we followed for some distance before dropping off to the south and crossing a swift-flowing burn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516277922"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4516277922_4a58872ac9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we contoured our way around the western end of Beinn Iutharn Mhor, coming across a small herd of deer and a great deal of frogs/toads enjoying the snowmelt and the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4515704511"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4515704511_bd8c504a35_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of us Carn an Righ and Beinn a' Ghlo looked very close. Now we turned south, picking our way along an animal track that hugged the side of the mountain above a snow-choked burn. A break for a snack and a map consult and we picked our course; climbing up a burn below the dark flanks of Carn an Righ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516357102"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4013/4516357102_a5aa0d2c4a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part way up we spotted members of the Cairngorm Club who had contoured around from Beinn Iutharn Mhor's summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4515727243"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4515727243_9530d57232_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with them as they paused for a snack below the track leading off to Carn an Righ. However, Glas Tulaichean still stood between us and the pub at the Spittal of Glenshee, several miles distant. With the advancing hour we decided to give the King's hill a miss and turned east to follow a narrow track which gently climbed towards the outfalls of Loch nan Eun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516370786"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4001/4516370786_8e13281550_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had to cross two snow-filled burns to get to Glas Tuliachean's north-east shoulder. The first of these was broken by a huge crevasse, more than a dozen feet deep, which had to be stepped over with some trepidation. After this there was a steep climb up to the north-east ridge which still carried plenty of snow, albeit slushy in the heat of the day. The views opened up, back over Loch nan Eun and the surrounding peaks, as well as to the myriad peaks of Beinn a' Ghlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4515764877"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4515764877_a7e5dc430f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It only took me a few minutes to traverse the snow slopes and climb up onto the deserted summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516406572"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2762/4516406572_f2d9df2501_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, under the beautiful afternoon skies which had begun to cloud over, there were magnificent views all about. I took the time to get a couple of self-portraits and then sat with my back to the trig point to breathe in the stunning surroundings. My last trip up this mountain had been in the mist and drizzle of a Scottish spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4513423523"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2369/4513423523_f280bf1135_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying this perfect afternoon we dropped south from the summit on a more subtle vehicle track than the unsightly scar that rises further east. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516479012"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2740/4516479012_8fb451cdc8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heather here was short and springy and we made quick progress down to the ruin in Glen Lochsie. Our final obstacle was a fast-flowing burn that had stratified evidence of deep, deep snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4516498328"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2713/4516498328_89694eecc1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once across this though I picked up the dismantled railway line and made rapid progress along it to the Dalmunzie Hotel. The views back up Gleann Taitneach, now glowing in the afternoon sunshine, were beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4515941799"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2678/4515941799_abe6f7e2d3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Corbett of Ben Gulabin kept me company as I trudged down the 1.5 miles of tarmac to the Spittal of Glenshee where an ice cold beer was the reward for almost twenty miles, climbing two Munros, and all in just 8.5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day rosy red hands, neck and nose told of a spectacularly sunny day in the Scottish mountains. Spring has sprung at last.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Beinn a' Ghlo</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/03/beinn-a-ghlo/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-07T22:31:14+00:00</published><updated>2010-03-07T22:31:14+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-03-07:/blog/2010/03/beinn-a-ghlo/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 13.8 miles&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parking point was a quagmire of mud but I managed to get the car backed up onto a fairly solid piece of ground and got out to boot up. The heavy cloud cover was a bit discouraging, but it seemed like it might lift just above Munro height with some time. As it was, Beinn aâ€™ Ghlo was living up to its name with the first summit, Carn Liath, wreathed in mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was getting ready two other folk arrived, parking their cars by the side of the road and discussing whether there was enough room for a tractor to slip by. I said â€˜helloâ€™ as I passed and dropped down to the gate marked Shinagag, which led onto a vehicle track climbing up rolling snow-covered slopes towards the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4414568894"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4011/4414568894_56ed4e3500_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easier to walk on the raised verges than the snowy track and I enjoyed this first part of the walk. There was no breeze and my winter layers were already a bit too much for the relatively mild conditions. Below me, across the frozen surface of Loch Moraig, a faint mist hung in the valley containing the A9 and Blair Atholl. At just before 9am, and being first off the marks, it was calm and peaceful all about me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4414525156"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4039/4414525156_d858a4ed68_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the pair of huts I left the vehicle track and struck north across a boggy area of land, riddled with numerous streams, some frozen some flowing. A path came visible here and there, eventually meeting the line of an old stone wall and turning towards Carn Liath south-west flank. As the ground rose the path became more distinct and I made good progress up to the start of the snowline at around 700m. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4413841353"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4413841353_018882e3f6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the going got a bit tricky with the snow quality changing step-by-step from soft and slushy to hard ice. I was following a distinct set of footprints up the mountain but at times these were reduced to the merest slit in the ice. I was committed and didnâ€™t have a chance to stop for crampons so instead front pointed my way up, occasionally step-cutting with my axe and reached the relatively safety of a patch of bare, heathery ground. I was probably only around 150m below the summit by now but used the opportunity to don crampons. With these attached the slope was taken with much greater confidence and soon eased off, just as I entered the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4414672888"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2746/4414672888_070dbd2706_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed by the first marker and eventually came to the snow-blasted trig point, a beacon of dirty-grey concrete in a white, disorientating world. It was 9:30am and with no views I paused only briefly for a glug of water before heading off the summit in a north-westerly direction. As I descended the cloud billowed and for a few moments a vista of the route ahead was revealed. The second Munro Braigh Coire Chruinn-bhalgain was wreathed in cloud but Airgiod Bheinn and Carn nan Gabhar looked more promising. I also saw the sinuous line taken by the ridge I was on, bending first west, then east, then west again to drop to the bealach with BCCB. No sooner had I taken a few quick snaps but the mist closed in again and I continued on my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418181030"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4418181030_ab85c880dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compacted snow gave great conditions for crampons and I made good progress, following the ridge line and then dropping down to the bealach. Occasional breaks in the cloud gave me views ahead until I dropped out of it completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418197434"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2717/4418197434_c2553f932a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slope was steep on the far side but a distinct line of tracks followed the curve of the mountain as it came around from east to north, making a line for the summit. I passed a couple of Ptarmigan waddling around in their winter coats. It was only at this point that I spotted the people following me as they summited Carn Liath just as I disappeared once again into the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418319504"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4061/4418319504_1e7bb65a0b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I navigated along the ridge to the cairn on top of BCCB and sat down on the far side to take a spot of tea and enjoy a snack. It was 10:30am and already I had made good progress despite the poor conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the next bit of navigation was going to be key. In near whiteout conditions the lip of the cornice on my right hand side was the key handrail. With map, compass and GPS I kept this at a steady distance to my right and followed my progress until the line started to bend away. I then paced out the steps to get to a point approximately midway on the ridge (GR 953728), double checked my GPS and then turned, finding with some relief a number of tracks congregating as the ground dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4417585281"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4417585281_378469c410_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I came out of the billowing clouds to find the next bealach below my feet and an easy crampon descent down to it on compacted snow. To my left the ribs of Carn na Gabhar stretched off down a wide gully running north-north-west. To my right I could see the first possible descent route off Beinn a' Ghlo. Strangely, investigation of the area revealed only a set of ski tracks heading down from the bealach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring this puzzle for the moment I started up the steep slope to reach the south ridge of Carn nan Gabhar. The snow again was hard and easy to walk up in crampons and again I disappeared into the cloud. Contouring beneath Airgiod Bheinn I came up to the ridge at the wide col between the two hills and struck north towards the summit. As I climbed a momentary break in the clouds revealed the first cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4417590491"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4417590491_503dcbbdc1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this ascent I encountered the first really deep snow of the day, which, in crampons hampered my progress. It probably would have made life easier to have removed them but I continued valiantly on, clambering up to the cairn to take in the magnificently white views. I then struck out across the flattish plateau, in short time reach the trig point, the south side of which had had its hoar frost covering chipped away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418362988"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2741/4418362988_ff9588989a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued on to the true summit which the OS claim to be 9 meters higher than the trig point. This is clearly baloney, a vicious rumour started to ensure hillwalkers wade another few meters through deep snow just to get the tick! Despite this I arrived just before twelve and in time for a delightful lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned by my outward route, passing the trig point and reaching again the first cairn. Here the clouds parted to give some views back towards BCCB and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4417606051"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4417606051_983b22a03e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4417634243"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2684/4417634243_be8dbe51f0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418388308"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4040/4418388308_9a05f8231c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched as two skiers made their way down to the bealach, and further behind them, the two walkers who I had said hello to at the car park just leaving the summit point. I dropped down from Carn na Gabhar and went back onto the compass as I was wrapped once again in cloud. I decided to try the descent of Airgiod Bheinn, in spite of some warnings of its steepness. The ridge itself was fairly featureless but narrow enough that I could easily keep sight of both sides and stay towards the centre. As the map indicates the western side is very steep but the eastern gentler so as I descended I veered more that way, following to roll of the ridge as it dropped out of the cloud. Here and there I found footprints coming up the way which was somewhat heartening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418412408"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2735/4418412408_171389e6f8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once out of the cloud I could see my target, the path dropping down the side of Beinn Bheag. The descent at this point became very steep but I was still able to crampon down quite happily holding my axe ready to arrest a fall. The ridge came down into a steep snow-filled gulley which I chose to avoid by  moving to the right and dropping down slopes that had increasing patches of heather peeking through. Eventually the gradient relented and I was able to pick a starting point and glissade down to the stream bed. Here ski tracks and footprints dropping down from the bealach converged, crossed the stream and picked up the path on the far side. I followed them and on reaching the path paused for a final brew and a chance to properly stow the crampons and lose a layer of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4418437998"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4418437998_62509cd4a8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk out was uneventful. I followed the path as it contoured around Beinn Bheag giving views back up to Airgiod Bheinn  and the other peaks of Beinn a' Ghlo. The light was strangely flat and had barely changed since 8 that morning. The track was a mixture of bog, mud, snow and ice and I walked in the heather more often than on the track. Eventually it gave way to a muddled set of tracks and bogs which I turned away from and dropped onto a vehicle track. This eventually merged with another, more substantial track that led me back to the huts. A chap was lying on the grass beside one taking the air, I waved as I passed but was on a mission to get back to the car. With Carn Liath behind I made rapid progress back down, arriving at the now congested parking area 7 hrs 54 mins after setting off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4420704074"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2775/4420704074_296e184878_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a very satisfying day, despite the lack of views, and gives me a few ideas for a return in the summer where Iâ€™d like to start off with the two Munros further west and then come on to Carn na Ghabar from the north and return along the ridge, hopefully getting the views I missed this time around. I might throw in a wild camp in Glen Tilt along the way!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Morrone</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2010/01/morrone/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-09T22:45:50+00:00</published><updated>2010-01-09T22:45:50+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2010-01-09:/blog/2010/01/morrone/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time: 5hrs 50 mins (including 20 mins of stops)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4261859903"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2677/4261859903_95a3c99842_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braemar was under heavy snow but the roads were clear and a steady stream of shoppers, walkers and skiers made the place look quite bustling. Icicles hung impressively from the eaves of the buildings and all around the hills were white from summit to glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262724770"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4262724770_d624e2da44_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vague plan was to attempt the Morrone horseshoe which includes Morrone, Carn na Drochaide and Carn Mar before descending to the Mar road and returning to Braemar. We passed the Duck Pond (though the ducks had abandoned the icebound water for a home away from home) and headed up past the few houses to the viewpoint at the foot of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262260361"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4056/4262260361_97d01fcb36_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were relatively few tracks about and in fact as we started the ascent we overtook the only other hiker about who was toiling up through deep, powdery snow. We followed the course of the path for some way with the views opening out all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262277151"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://static.flickr.com/4031/4262277151_48a77e2d85_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was tough going though, often sinking waist deep, and breaking trail offered no respite. After some time I broke away from the line of the path and made a beeline for the plateau, hoping this would offer some respite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4263045700"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4263045700_8f6a0acc09_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once up we marvelled at the views: over to Loch Callater and the hills around Glas Maol, east down Deeside towards Morvern, and into the heart of the Cairngorms, hidden by a cap of cloud. Ahead of us we spied the mast of the weather station and with the going eased by slightly shallower snow we were soon there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262326459"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4036/4262326459_c87dca068c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent had already taken us two hours so as we sat eating lunch and marvelling at the snowy landscape all around we altered our plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262314181"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4262314181_0c91c5f0c6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After descending Morrone to the col below Carn na Drochaide we contoured around the ridge slightly and then headed for a point deep in the Glen of Corriemulzie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4263137504"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4028/4263137504_b6f5be8bdc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This descent was a delight, wading through deep, light powder with fantastic views all around and the sun shining on us. There were plenty of tracks in the snow but only one mountain hare was spied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262481329"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4262481329_d100fe5ac5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got into the shadows of the glen the snow deepened again and after crossing the burn, threading a narrow course between banks of snow, we picked up the line of the track but again found deep snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4263636914"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4054/4263636914_33546f531c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We paused for another brief snack and a drink before moving on. In the glen it was certainly well below freezing and there was a huge temperature contrast following all the exertions of the descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4262914619"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4262914619_853ece2d93_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now followed the line of the burn as it ran down to meet the Dee. As we approached the road we were treated to two small groups of deer wading through the snow. The clouds again had come in making the hills behind us look very wintry. After a short forest section we gained the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4265617762"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2759/4265617762_1bb17cfa5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As snow started to drift down to headed back to Braemar, taking in the stunning views up the Dee (which was largely frozen over and hidden by snow) as well as the icicles formed by small burns trickling down the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4265672962"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4265672962_4bf83f0a61_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six hours on the hills we arrived back in Braemar where a well deserved couple of pints were consumed as we waited for the bus back to Aberdeen. A thoroughly excellent day and just reward for a lot of expended energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>Braeriach</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/05/braeriach/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-16T23:47:22+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-16T23:47:22+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-05-16:/blog/2009/05/braeriach/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 16th May 2009&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paths in this area of the national park are excellent and we made good time, climbing up away from the road and walking towards the Chalamain Gap with the ski centre and funicular railway away on our left hand side. The cloud base was sitting at around 900m and with the sun beginning to shine over Aviemore there was an optimistic air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3539775594"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1210504_b.jpg" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2454/3539775594_797b19af47_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scramble through the Chalamain gap (always makes me want to sign &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylr2D4Pwn58"&gt;Kid Charlemagne&lt;/a&gt; by Steely Dan...) was taken at a variety of paces on a number of routes. The jumble of boulders giving lots of opportunities for a slide, a stumble and some good scrambling but we emerged at the bealach below Craeg a Chalamain largely unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3538991011"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1210515_b.jpg" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2117/3538991011_89f1a94636_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrow ribbon of the Lairig Ghru track was away below and this is what we made for, joining it just below the former site of the Sincliar Hut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst until now it had seemed that the sun might make a bid for freedom, at the Sinclair Hut (NH959037) it closed in and a steady rain began to fall. We had elevenses here (though it was closer to 12:30 after the late start) before donning waterproofs and heading up the good track on the other side of the Ghru. This climbed steeply up the north-eastern ridge of Braeriach although after only a hundred meters or so of ascent we were in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress was slow as we tried to maintain close distance between groups. This was largely successful until I deviated from the main path (around NH964014), instead choosing to navigate using the cairns which mark the two bumps on the ridge. The following group took the path but we didn't know this until later. There was a tense ten minutes until we were reunited at the cairn of Sron na Lairige.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we had an entertaining twenty minutes where we dropped off the wrong side of the hill in the mist and ended up having to turn back on ourselves. Eventually we were back on course and at the col below the main summit plateau. We contoured round and rejoined the main track which emerged from under the first of several snow fields. Following footprints and the track was easy enough despite the visibility being virtually zero, and the wind blowing the cloud fiercely into our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After what seemed like an hour the terrain finally levelled off and we came across the summit cairn, poised close to the cliffs in a deep layer of snow. A little further west we found a sheltered spot to gratefully take lunch. It had been an exhausting toil up from the Lairig Ghru and was now well into the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the time our original plan to continue across the plateau and then drop into Gleann Einich was abandoned in favour of returning by the inward route. Following the path the whole way this time we made much better progress, eventually dropping down out of the claustrophobic clouds. They had slightly lifted so we got raggedy views down from the final part of the ridge into the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the Sinclair Hut area waterproofs were taken off and under a brightening sky we started the long march out to Coylumbridge. At first the path was treachorous with rocks and stones but as we approached the trees lower down it improved and we cracked on at a much better pace. Into the trees and the sun finally appeared, bathing everything in the glow of a late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got further towards the finish of the day we passed people cooking dinner outside their tents and the occassional family on mountain bikes. Eventually we emerged back at the main road and had a weary walk down the pavement to the Coylumbridge Hotel where the coach was waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a long trip and though the views were non-existent it was nonetheless rewarding to get to the top of the UK's third highest peak in less than ideal conditions. The GPS earnt its bread today though it should be noted that the compass got us out of the 180 turn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only took photos until just after the Chalamain Gap but here they are: &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/sets/72157618266312689/"&gt;Flickr Photoset&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Broad Cairn &amp; Cairn Bannoch</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/05/broad-cairn-cairn-bannoch/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-10T20:24:08+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-10T20:24:08+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-05-10:/blog/2009/05/broad-cairn-cairn-bannoch/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 15 miles&lt;br&gt;

The summer triangle was creeping above the horizon and looking at my laptop the weather forecast promised a continuation of this clear spell at least until midday. MWIS concurred with the eastern hills being given an 80% chance of being cloud free during Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

MWIS concurred with the eastern hills being given an 80% chance of being cloud free during Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the promise of a good sunrise and the stars signalling the return to short summer nights I packed the sack, made some food and quietly loaded everything into the car, trying not to disturb the neighbours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rolled out of Aberdeen, accompanied by a few taxi drivers and wandering revellers a little after 2am and was soon alone on the A93 behind the far-reaching beams of my headlamps. The roads were, of course, quiet and I passed unnoticed through the villages along the Dee, eventually crossing the river at Ballater and picking up the road to the Spittal of Glenmuick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was eerie making my way down the single track. Every passing place sign and snowpole was illuminated far in front of me by my lights. More unnerving though were the small packs of deer that, at my approach, decided they wanted to be on the other side of the road as quickly as possible. Thankfully I made it to the carpark without harming any wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A campervan, a car and an estate truck were the only vehicles in evidence at the car park at 3:30am. I found I only had £2.90 in change (the rest being 5ps which the machine does not accept). I left the car without ticket thinking that I'd be back and out before the crowds arrived anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night was still and peaceful and it was a delight to walk along the good track towards Loch Muick. I had the headtorch but after passing through the trees switched it off, letting my senses adjust to the sights and sounds of the tranquil pre-dawn. In the east there was already a lightening of the sky evident, the hills standing black against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3517504669"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Muick at Dawn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3555/3517504669_9767e77e73_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made steady progress along the west side of the Loch, stopping occasionally to watch as the glow in the east steadily grew. The colour of the Loch was wonderful. In front of me I saw Broad Cairn emerge from the gloaming, its peak scattered with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518316420"&gt;&lt;img alt="Broad Cairn at Dawn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3317/3518316420_409c653425_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the light grew I climbed the zig-zagging track up to reach the high plateau leading up to Broad Cairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3517514221"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Muick" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3395/3517514221_b658c2a77d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clouds were sticking over Lochnanagar and also Broad Cairn, sitting at around 900m. Above, the sky was turning red as a glow appeared beyond Mount Keen under a dark band of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518339254"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Mount Keen" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3303/3518339254_011508e695_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518379416"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunrise over the hills of Glen Muick" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3625/3518379416_3f79f52b74_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 5am approached I dropped my sack and sat back on a rock perched high above the Loch to watch the sun arrive. The changing quality of light was magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518336690"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_0669.CR2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3318/3518336690_3cdfdd2c77_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this I carried on, passing Sandy's Seat and getting views into Glen Clova. The snow of the past week had transformed Mayar and Dreish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518385860"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning sun on Mayar &amp;amp; Dreish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3562/3518385860_3fb11ef450_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3517575371"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking south to Glen Clova" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3626/3517575371_324e16aa1e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb up Broad Cairn is straightforward, with a track much of the way and only a bit of clambering required to ascend through the boulder fields. The only slight difficulty was the rocks encrusted with a thick layer of frost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3517573819"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Broad Cairn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3320/3517573819_a6e740d207_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 6am approached I was at the summit, clambering up to the cairn and sitting down just out of the bitingly cold wind to enjoy the views and some breakfast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3517576921"&gt;&lt;img alt="A burst of sunlight" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3566/3517576921_6c9d20808a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518263372"&gt;&lt;img alt="Early Morning Sun Over Loch Muick" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3400/3518263372_85df1e1331_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a couple of shots as unfortunately the cloud drifted in once again, obscuring the sun and plunging me into a cold mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518911150"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Glen Muick" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/3518911150_30c5b377e9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a bearing off the summit for the next top but just below the cairn picked up a good track which wound its way across the plateau, across the top of Cairn of Galloch, and then up and on to Cairn Bannoch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518106269"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track towards Cairn Bannoch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3640/3518106269_760cd68d10_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise was hardly anything which was appropriate as neither was the view. After only a couple of minutes spent in the swirling mist I headed down from the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518110377"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Cairn Bannoch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3341/3518110377_e036f844c0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clear weather it would have been good to head down to the crags above the Dubh Loch but in the conditions I went south west from the summit and picked up a snowfilled burn which took me down towards the Allt an Dubh-loch. I carefully picked my way across to the fast flowing stream, the views starting to open out. Most impressive was the waterfall tumbling down the Eagle Rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518129927"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt an Dubh0loch below Eagles Rock" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3518129927_ab0f843af8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the Allt and followed its left bank downhill towards the Dubh Loch which could now be seen between the steep sides of the crags. It was an impressive sight despite the overhead cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518141135"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tumbling into the Dubh Loch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3656/3518141135_08666acb42_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518150323"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Dubh Loch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3312/3518150323_29ce74dd32_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I dropped down the faint traces of a path could be seen and I now followed this until it became more distinct as shown on the map. Close to the Loch it was very boggy but as it rose up at the Loch's foot it became much better and progress was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518211319"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over the Allt an Dubh-loch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3592/3518211319_3b08b0f42d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path drops impressively down the side of the head of Glen Muick towards the Loch with the views opening out on all sides. Besides me Broad Cairn was starting to emerge from the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3518265539"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking up towards the Dubh Loch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3651/3518265539_2499437ae5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a good path I was soon at Glas-allt-Shiel, pausing by the Loch in front of the house. After this it was a walk back down the side of Loch Muick, passing the boathouse and returning to the car just on 9am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3519145418"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Muick from the northern end" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/3519145418_3b831b8c8c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sat drinking a brew the first daywalkers were pulling into the car park and booting up. It felt good to have had this busy place completely to myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Into the Heart of the Cairngorms</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/05/into-the-heart-of-the-cairngorms/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-02T23:24:42+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-02T23:24:42+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-05-02:/blog/2009/05/into-the-heart-of-the-cairngorms/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2nd May 2009&lt;br&gt;

I'd been over Beinn Bhrotain last year but that had been in cloud. I was hoping today to get a proper sight of Glen Dee and the giants at the heart of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After overcoming the slow traffic I finally pulled up at the Linn of Dee carpark at 8:30am. It seemed most people were ahead of me and I only found a space as I was almost out of the circle again! Booted up and with sunshine peeking over the tops of the pine trees it was with an optimistic air that I set off towards Derry Lodge. Last year I'd returned via Whitebridge so again this was new ground and a pleasant walk it is too, leaving the pine trees and then heading up the broad Glen Lui with the first and last of today's hills, Carn a Mhaim and Carn Crom on display above the trees surrounding Derry Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498170043"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track through Glen Lui" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3498170043_191084d96e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derry Lodge is in need of a bike shed I feel - there were many scattered here and there, some behind the Mountain Rescue hut and others by the tree near the bridge. Clearly a lot of people are tired of walking the track from the Linn of Dee. I kept on my feet though and after crossing the bridge took an immediate left to follow the Corrour Bothy expressway. It wound over boggy ground near the river before rising up around the lower slopes of Carn Crom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498182077"&gt;&lt;img alt="Luibeg Burn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3604/3498182077_64f99bf0c7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed a few people on the track here and it was soon clear that the pull up to Carn a Mhaim would be steep going. First of all though I had a pleasant cup of tea by the Luibeg just below the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499844735"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Luibeg Bridge" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3554/3499844735_a99d0b5656_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had investigated the crossing lower down but decided it would be silly to run the risk of getting wet feet when someone had gone to the trouble of installing a bridge! Sadly, on the other side of the bridge the return path to the Corrour highway is very boggy and just as I reached the gate onto the open hillside the first of the day's showers arrived. Waterproof jacket was on and head was down for the climb up a good track that pretty much attacked the hill head on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498200639"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Carn a' Mhaim" src="http://static.flickr.com/3650/3498200639_16fa59788a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me, views back down towards the Lui were lush and green whilst north and east, the grey slopes of Derry Cairngorm were attracting some mist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499019578"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down Glen Luibeg" src="http://static.flickr.com/3363/3499019578_6befcae329_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial steepness eased off as the first crags were reached. The path heads round to the left side of them giving you a sudden view over Glen Dee onto Devil's Point rising over the ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498209503"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Devil's Point" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3642/3498209503_2d648644ea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A snow slope then led up towards Carn a' Mhaims summit. The snow was easy enough to kick through and the rewards were stunning. A clear view from the summit directly onto the Devil's Point, down to the Corrour Bothy and north towards the Lairig Ghru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499042726"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn a' Mhaim (1037m)" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3343/3499042726_4a1a51ec51_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially Ben Macdui and Braeriach were both in the clouds but as I stopped for a bite to eat and to take pictures the wind blew things through and I got a good sight of my next target, Macdui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499048094"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Macdui" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3649/3499048094_2e4d530e2b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ridge off Carn a' Mhaim is a delight with the views ever more majestic and some little scrabbles over bumps to keep things interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3494297657"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Devil's Point" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3340/3494297657_7ed411ec7c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside is the heightloss with the col between Mhaim and Macdui being around 800m. The path turned northeast climbing up Macdui but eventually becoming lost in a boulder field which was arduous going for the last 300m or so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498281205"&gt;&lt;img alt="The col between Carn a' Mhaim and Macdui" src="http://static.flickr.com/3363/3498281205_5c107ff92b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only was it a boulder field but it also had plenty of false summits which really shouldn't be allowed. At this time a snow shower came in and I lost sight of the summit. However as I arrived on the icy plateau it had again blown through and I could see a few figures heading up to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499106410"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1210194_b.jpg" src="http://static.flickr.com/3600/3499106410_46009af624_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up tracks across this snow and ice bound area I was soon heading up the final few hundred meters to the summit where a trig point looked over a desolate area of rocks and fresh snow. A few shelters scattered around were being used by people to keep out of the icy wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498300411"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Ben Macdui (1309m)" src="http://static.flickr.com/3370/3498300411_aec6ce3bc1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking someone's photo at the trig point I headed slightly north to get a panoramic view of the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3496768198"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from Ben Macdui looking west" src="http://static.flickr.com/3299/3496768198_994315ae04_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eating lunch behind one of the summit shelters I descended Ben Macdui, heading east and down a long snow slope towards the main track down to Loch Etchachan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498335311"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etchachan" src="http://static.flickr.com/3627/3498335311_11d48a7c67_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the snow ran out I picked up a track that went along the top of the cliffs above Coire Sputan Dearg getting the occassional view through yet another snow shower to Derry Cairngorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498314393"&gt;&lt;img alt="Buttress above Core Sputan Dearg" src="http://static.flickr.com/3582/3498314393_2095e8abbd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The snow was heaviest as I left Loch Etchachan and crossed the bealach east of Coire Sputan Dearg. Luckily through it yet again blew through and the sun came out. The views back to Macdui were magnificent and as I followed the track up to Derry's summit I got lovely views onto the Lochan Uaine nestled in its stunning corrie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3494334667"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Southern Top of Ben MacDui" src="http://static.flickr.com/3305/3494334667_3f241443ba_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3496748562"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn a' Mhaim from below Derry Cairngorm" src="http://static.flickr.com/3356/3496748562_885e3ffe86_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3496770934"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Sputan Dearg and Sron Riach" src="http://static.flickr.com/3610/3496770934_aa62084d2a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another boulder field was much better in sunshine and soon enough I was on the summit of Derry Cairngorm, once again enjoying magnificent views. Beinn a' Ghlo had lost its cloud cover, and Lochnagar was just emerging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499162740"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track between Macdui and Derry" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3338/3499162740_fc8dda136e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I descended south, following the bumps and well worn track down from Derry and then along to Carn Crom. I met a few people coming up the way here and the sun now seemed to have settled in for the afternoon. It was a wonderfully pleasant walk. I even bumped into some local wildlife clambering down the side above Coire na Cloiche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3498433841"&gt;&lt;img alt="Derry Cairngorm from Carn Crom" src="http://static.flickr.com/3307/3498433841_cf2fba718f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit of Carn Crom doesn't appear to be very popular but is worth a visit as it gives great views back up into Glen Dee and Macdui, as well as east towards Beinn Bhreach and a huge vista south with the Glas Maol group and Glas Tulaichean dominating. I had my final tea stop here, enjoying the peace and solitude before heading back to the track and dropping down into Glen Derry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path is well engineered and gets you down into the trees below Creag Bad an t-Seabhaig very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499278452"&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching Derry Lodge" src="http://static.flickr.com/3344/3499278452_25b9618e32_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the Derry and sat by the bank watching a few groups of campers, loaded with kit, hitting the Courrour Expressway. It was idyllic in the late afternoon sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3499293498"&gt;&lt;img alt="Final view down Glen Lui" src="http://static.flickr.com/3581/3499293498_2cf2994ac0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all that was left was the stroll back along Glen Lui to the car at Linn of Dee. All told it was around 21 miles and I completed it in around 8 hrs 15 minutes with stops. It had been an epic but rewarding day. I knew that given the amount of snow showers around I had been very fortunate to get three clear summits and the wonderful views! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Carn na Drochaide</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/03/carn-na-drochaide/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-14T22:45:12+00:00</published><updated>2009-03-14T22:45:12+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-03-14:/blog/2009/03/carn-na-drochaide/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hills: Carn na Drochaide (Corbett, 818m)&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seemed the hillwalkers forecast on Sunday morning had been wrong; for much of the journey out from Aberdeen on the 201 Stagecoach the skies were blue and the first hills looked beautiful. Morven in particular, with a cap of pristine fresh snow (we had seen the clouds march towards Aberdeen on Thursday but they had never hit), looked stunning. We passed through Ballater where there was a thin covering of snow on the green by the church, but it was only really as we entered the trees a few miles before Crathie that things changed. The bus driver commented â€œit was like going through the wardrobe into Narniaâ€. All of sudden the branches were laden with snow, and fresh flakes were drifting down onto a ground that was increasingly white and winter-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hopped off the bus at Keiloch and zipped up against the fresh westerly wind that was coming straight down from the upper reaches of the Dee. The tramp along the Invercauld estate road was fine with views onto the nearby hills. A quarter of a mile or so in front of me a solitary walker emerged from the trees and was engulfed in a spiralling column of spin drift â€“ it would have made a great photo but my camera was tucked away against the elements, deep in the folds of a dry bag!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3339227208"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn na Drochaide" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3335/3339227208_eb3d791918_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I took the Slugain track I got a view of Carn na Drochaide. It was to be my last of the day until I came off the traverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slugain is a remote and lonely feeling place, even in the summer when I was last here. It seems to attract a covering of mist and with snow billowing through the gap at its head it was eyes down and keep on trooping. Only one pair of footprints, going both there and back, were a sign of human passage on the good double track. Against the wind there was neither sight nor sound of animal and even the chattering burn seemed to be muted by the conditions. At its worse I was considering turning back but the weather has funny ways and each time this happened the sun peeked through the clouds and offered me a glimpse of the hills in front of me. I pressed on thinking I could at least make it to the ruin at the head of the glen and then, if necessary, return back by the same route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3339237414"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading up Gleann an t-Slugain" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3553/3339237414_e3fdc33d78_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the climb up the delightful path through the fairy glen was the most enjoyable part of the day so far. In the tight confines between steep slopes it was sheltered from the wind and the snow drifted down in picture-postcard perfection. I spied three chaps taking a brew stop down by the river â€“ they commented on what a lovely day it was! They were joking. They will return later in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3338412613"&gt;&lt;img alt="Near the ruin in Gleann an t-Slugain" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/3338412613_a561515f80_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the ruin itself I met another couple of brave folk who had come up, had lunch, and decided to head back down. To be honest I didn't blame them! Here I stopped to don waterproof trousers and add another layer to head and hands. I then broke trail in the fresh, deep snow heading up the track to the top of the glen. The wee lochan just above the ruin was a sorry sight, ringed by ice and snow but I picked out a route above it onto Carn na Drochaide's north-eastern slopes. I had planned to take in the other summits here but visibility was pretty much 0. Instead I took a bearing towards the summit and strode out into the mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately I fell waist deep into a snow covered burn.  After that initial problem though the going was reasonable with heather patches providing better going. Eventually I picked up a track which took me up to the western end of the summit where a small cairn/shelter had been built. As I came across the top from my relatively sheltered side the full force of the wind hit me and I got well and truly blown. I made for the shelter and basically had to lie down to keep out of the wind. Everything was rapidly icing up as I sipped a cup of tea and strained to see across to the actual summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3338438193"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn na Drochaide" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3319/3338438193_90e96e5b57_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily though I caught a break and after packing away my bag I looked around my shelter to find the briefest of gaps in the rolling snow clouds. Suddenly the mountains all around Braemar had opened up. I rapidly retrieved the camera from the bag and reeled off a few shots. No sooner had it arrived though than it disappeared, the visibility reducing and the view vanishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3339277148"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1200405_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3306/3339277148_77eb901f77_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3338464913"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1200415_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3307/3338464913_aafdf12899_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pressed onto the summit and found the large cairn. Still being battered by the wind and with no view I barely paused to set a bearing and make my way south, heading essentially for Braemar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I descended the heathery slopes down towards the day I was rewarded with a second opportunity to admire the view. This time sun lit up the White Mounth which looked glorious. I could even see west someway down the Dee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3338494545"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Braes of Mar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3657/3338494545_d08f79b5d4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3339345238"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow clouds over Morrone" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3334/3339345238_1062068fb0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I descended further, losing height and aiming for the public right of way which comes around from Quioch. As the snow transition into a number of small burns snaking across the hillside the snow again rolled in, thick and heavy and reducing visibility again. The track was easy to find though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was then simply a case of head down against the snow and marching back to Keiloch. Once back in the trees it was lovely, snow falling from laden branches and a smell of freshness in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed the Slugain burn and rejoined the track from Invercauld. Coming down the track from the Slugain were three figures who I thought might be the chaps from the Gleann. They weren't but turned out to be a party from the Cairngorm Club who had been to the South Summit of Beinn a'Bhuird but had turned back as it got icy. They were heading to Keiloch to catch their coach and kindly offered me a lift, first to the Fife in Braemar for a pint, and then back to Aberdeen. At the Fife I met the three guys from the Gleann who were also from the Cairngorm Club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent afternoon out - things for the next one though are a pair of goggles and a waterproof/windproof pair of mitts!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category><category term="201"></category></entry><entry><title>Morven</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/02/morven/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-21T23:29:22+00:00</published><updated>2009-02-21T23:29:22+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-02-21:/blog/2009/02/morven/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corbetts Climbed: Morven&lt;br&gt;

Not fully thinking through my walk, or more accurately changing my mind several times on the way, meant I added on six miles of tarmac drudgery onto what was otherwise a fantastic day out in the Cairngorm foothills. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've often seen Morven from other vantage points around Upper Deeside but for one reason or another had never made it up there. Today, whilst sitting on the 201 heading out towards Braemar I decided that I would set that record straight. Unfortunately I decided this only as we pulled into Ballater and so the first stage was to head back slightly east to Milton of Tullich to pick up the start point. After wending my way through the woods behind the school in Ballater I had a section of unavoidable tarmac along to the farm buildings from whence I picked up the track north towards my target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3298548518"&gt;&lt;img alt="Out of sight" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3552/3298548518_e5f124d803_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the "Morven" gate there was a pair of spectacles dangling on the adjacent fence. I wasn't sure how to interpret this sign so after donning gaiters I headed up into the back country. The ground was soft and springy underfoot, melt-water turning the track occassionally into more of a burn, but otherwise progress was good. At a small, unnamed lochan I disturbed an entire flock of ducks who were sheltering at the non-ice covered end. The climbing was for the most part gentle and it was lovely to see Pannanich Hill open up behind me, with very soon the distinct peak of Mt Keen visible in the background. Ahead the snow-speckled slopes of Crannaich Hill drew me ownwards, following the course of tumbling burn that had carved a deep groove between the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3297741833"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Morven" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3625/3297741833_b3c8ec7ae8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I climbed above the snowline I traversed several sections of deep, thawing snow. Conditions amongst the pines were mild but as I entered the broad and marshy land before Morven a strong westerly wind started to buffet me. Choosing a strategically placed rock I paused for a bite to eat, enjoying views onto the glorious cliffs of Lochnagar which were catching the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3298596614"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dramatic skies over Lochnagar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3622/3298596614_da8fc2fe6b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I started to pick my way up the steep southern slopes of Morven, following ribs of grass that angled up and to the west. Above me a group of three young deer danced across the rocks. I was less graceful, particular given the strength of the wind. Even higher up a glider could occasionally be seen through the shreds of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3298630548"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Morven" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3401/3298630548_6eed2887b6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I ascended I had to keep stopping to admire the amazing views that were opening out. Eventually I reached a subsidiary cairn at around NJ376038 which led me on to the broad summit plateau. It was only a couple of hundred metres across some slightly firmer snow patches to reach the summit cairn and trig point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3297837445"&gt;&lt;img alt="Approaching the summit of Morven" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3231/3297837445_8af4c3fcfd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I arrived a chap with a couple of dogs came up from the east. I paused for quite a while on the summit, standing in the howling wind to admire the view which was stunning in all directions. The Cairngorms, Lochnagar, Mt Keen, Clachnaben, the Dee Valley and Bennachie were the highlights. The clouds all around were dramatic and fast moving but I enjoyed sunshine. On the lee side of the cairn I sat down to enjoy a final snack and a brew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My basic aim was to catch the bus back from Dinnet. In hindsight I should have contoured around the hills of Roar Hill and Culblean and dropped down to Loch Kinord. Instead I followed the excellent track all the way off Morven to the parked cars at Balhennie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3298779002"&gt;&lt;img alt="At the bottom!" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3345/3298779002_2a606f7d79_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the amount of farmland around I had no choice but to take the tarmac route back. This ended in an unforgiving slog down the A97 into Dinnet. I put my iPod on and enjoyed the late afternoon sunshine with the occassional view back to Morven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3297960353"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morven under gathering cloud" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3298/3297960353_bd71a86ec4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a twenty minute wait in Dinnet before catching the 201 back to Aberdeen. It had been a long but enjoyable day out and not getting wet is always a bonus!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>Sgor Buidhe</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2009/01/sgor-buidhe/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-01-10T22:38:20+00:00</published><updated>2009-01-10T22:38:20+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2009-01-10:/blog/2009/01/sgor-buidhe/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This time last year I was heading up the flanks of Morrone in a deep covering of fresh snow.

This year's &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7808348.stm"&gt;detox walk&lt;/a&gt; was somewhat different with ice and winds providing the entertainment as Dave and I crossed the mysterious Sgor Buidhe plateau above Ballater.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We got the 08:45am 201 from Aberdeen which dropped us off at the Stagecoach depot in Ballater just before 10:30am. The streets in Aberdeen were shiny with recently fallen rain but as we set off through the back streets of Ballater there was nothing falling from the sullen skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk initially wound between houses and the sports field before crossing the Pass of Ballater road and heading up a forestry track into the pine covered slopes of ... . It took a while before a view opened out and initial slope was fairly steep and muddy. As we climbed to a point where the track curves around the hill to the left we saw ahead up the Tullich Burn to Morven with a beautiful cap of snow. By now the wet ground was solid ice, dangerous when unsighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="c"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1190327" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3393/3184759747_818f3e5072_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the track as it passed above a radio mast and then climbed up to the flat summit of the first hill, . Here we encountered the wind which rose strongly as we left the tree line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the wind which tried its hardest to blow us off course, we now had a straightforward walk across the tops, heading west. The wind was incredibly strong and we only spent a short time at the white rock which marked the summit of Sgor Buidhe. From here we followed the faint track to the final summit Craig of Prony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3184772731"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist over Ballater" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3429/3184772731_7139987fc9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the day slightly we descended from here north into a tributary of Glen Gairn, with Peter's Hill and Morven off to our left. The descent was steep and heathery but there was no complaining as it got us out of the wind. We came down to where a track forded the small stream and paused for a bite to eat and a look at the thick ice which was lingering at the edges of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3185661574"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ice" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3494/3185661574_3fcd44b566_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return route to Ballater was a very pleasant walk along springy paths through trees intially before we followed a farm track back to the Pass of Ballater. Reports suggested we might meet an unfriendly farmer so we skirted around the buildings of and then hopped across the barbed wire fence on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3185672438"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Dee near Craigendarroch Hilton" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3381/3185672438_801db90394_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After crossing the main road we descended down a steep bank close to the Craigendarroch Hilton and then enjoyed the last stretch along above the Dee, which also had signs of ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in Ballater we scoped out a few shops, found that the Prince of Wales hadn't yet woken up after Christmas and spent a warm hour or so in the pub next door.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Monadh Mor and Beinn Bhrotain</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/09/2008-09-13-monadh-mor-and-beinn-bhrotain/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-13T20:16:40+01:00</published><updated>2008-09-13T20:16:40+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-09-13:/blog/2008/09/2008-09-13-monadh-mor-and-beinn-bhrotain/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags: munro

&lt;p&gt;Fourteen hardy Stockets climbed aboard Gordon’s Luxury Coach at Mile End School early on Saturday morning. Silvester did an excellent job of tearing around the top of the Cairngorms but even so it was more than three hours after leaving Aberdeen that we rolled past turf-roofed houses in Glen Feshie and were deposited at the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourteen hardy Stockets climbed aboard Gordon’s Luxury Coach at Mile End School early on Saturday morning. Silvester did an excellent job of tearing around the top of the Cairngorms but even so it was more than three hours after leaving Aberdeen that we rolled past turf-roofed houses in Glen Feshie and were deposited at the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unusually the Munroists had a shorter route and so we bid farewell to the Glen Dwellers, led by Steve who disappeared off in what appeared to be the wrong direction. They were actually heading further south down Glen Feshie to pick up a Glen that would eventually bring them through to Whitebridge. Apparently it was a lovely walk with spectacular landscapes, marred slightly by the onset of blisters for one unlucky trekker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2855274033"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunlight in Glen Feshie" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3227/2855274033_ae2ed5346d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Munroists were heading up on a good track around the lower slopes of xxx before finally gaining the plateau by way of a steep slog up an eroded path. Initially sun had driven off the layers but by the time the plateau was reached most people were back on with midlayers and waterproofs against a wind that was driving cloud, rain-like into our faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a dedicated leader the task of navigating was shared amongst the company. Maps were consulted regularly in the mist and very often when a path ran out we were referring to our compasses. In unpleasant conditions we identified a suitable spot on the map for lunch, and after a rapid descent down a landrover track we found it by a gushing burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lunch was a relatively brief affair and we were soon crossing over and heather-bashing our way up the other side, making our way for the top of Tom Dubh and Liz’s prime objective of the day. Premature celebrations occurred when I found a small mist-shrouded cairn but the group’s opinion was that given the subsequent rise in the ground beyond me I was not yet at the top. A few minutes later a much more substantial cairn was found and with a little help from multiple GPS units, our position was identified as on top of Tom Dubh. In the mist it could just as easily have been Tom Buidhe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming off this seemingly innocent and insignificant top we came across the great obstacle of the day, the Allt Luineag, which came down a steep sided, almost straight gully. With the water high and fast it posed something of a puzzle and only some brave venturing forth with poles took the first person across the rocks to the other side. Three intrepid folk headed further upstream to try their luck and successfully reappeared a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With regrouping achieved again compasses were taken out and by reading the countours we found our way across another spot height and then on to the final slope of Monadh Mor, a steep grassy slope with occasional rocky patches. The summit was soon achieved after only a little discussion of the slope of the plateau. It was still very misty so after brief discussions we again split, three headed by Liz seeking a different way off the plateau by way of Glen Geusachan, and the remaining heading now southeast along the broad summit towards Beinn Bhrotain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the crags as a handrail we navigated our way across the narrow col and then up the final bouldery slopes to the Bhrotain plateau. In thick mist we regrouped and discussed the probable location of the summit. 10s after heading off in our chosen direction we found the trig point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2855280993"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Beinn Bhrotain" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3089/2855280993_9d26a26632_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for compass treachery and moving of trig points was discussed before photos were taken and a last intake of energy. After refreshments we continued, taking a south-easterly bearing and descending down into Coire an t-Sneachda. Eventually the burn in the coire became more of a stream and we were able to follow it as it tumbled off the hill and into the River Dee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we came off the hill the views opened out and we had atmospheric views deep into Glen Dee and the feet of some of the Cairngorm giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2856132122"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1180122_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/2856132122_c47cdc58bd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a final stop to shed layers we trooped off down the track by the river, catching up walkers from the low group shortly after passing White Bridge. The coach was found at the Linn of Dee and then we had a wee wait for the folk who had avoided the summit of Bhrotain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our attempt to stop at the Inver was foiled so we continued onto the POW in Ballater where a more obliging bar attendent served tea to those who wanted it and beer to the sensible folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much shorter coach ride back got us to Aberdeen for 9:30pm. A long but ultimately rewarding day.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Beinn Iutharn Mhor</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/08/2008-08-18-beinn-iutharn-mhor/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-18T23:37:09+01:00</published><updated>2008-08-18T23:37:09+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-08-18:/blog/2008/08/2008-08-18-beinn-iutharn-mhor/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags: munro

&lt;p&gt;Our day started with a close encounter with Morning Prayer on Radio Scotland but sadly, as we trudged along the landrover track towards the foot of Beinn Iutharn Mhor, it became increasingly clear that the rain gods had not been appeased by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our day started with a close encounter with Morning Prayer on Radio Scotland but sadly, as we trudged along the landrover track towards the foot of Beinn Iutharn Mhor, it became increasingly clear that the rain gods had not been appeased by this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A fairly uneventful journey, broken only by a diversion through Torphins due to a nasty accident on the A93, brought us to the start of the farm track at Baddoch shortly before 9am on Sunday morning. The clouds had been low all the way, shrouding the higher peaks as we made our way from Ballater through to Braemar and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From our start point we were initially held up by a contingent of army cadets who struggled to negotiate a kissing gate with full overnight bags. After that it was a quick march down the wide landrover track. About ten minutes after starting the rain kicked into action and a myriad of waterproofs were put on. It didn’t really stop raining for another two or so hours, during which time we had everything from light drizzle through to driving rain. It wasn’t particularly pleasant and our heads were kept down so we couldn’t enjoy the views that were opening out as we got further up the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following our stop for elevenses next to a grouse grit cache the rain eased but the terrain turned damp as we left the end of landrover track and picked our way through a series of bogs and meandering rivulets that were coming down from the wide slopes around us.  Despite a few trips in the heather we arrived safely at the north shore of Loch nan Eun where lunch was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2775773954"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the summit, into the mist" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3083/2775773954_15c503004e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the group split, three heading for Beinn Iutharn Beag, directly to the north, and the majority heading towards the Munro of Beinn Iutharn Mhor, not too much further along to the east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound our way around the countours until the final pull up to the summit was marked by a clear path up through boulders and grass. All around us rags of cloud and mist were being blown through by a strong wind. Luckily this was to our backs as we headed up the final part of the climb. In front as I got higher the mist closed in and all I could do was keep on climbing until the eerie silhouette of the cairn appeared some distance in front of me. It was lost again as the mist thickened but keeping on that bearing I soon came to it. Large enough to have a shelter on its lee side we crouched down behind to catch our breath and admire the fine views of thick mist and cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now turned east-ward, encountering the full force of the wind as we made our way along the broad flat ridge leading down from the summit. In an effort to eascape the wind we ventured onto the north side of the mountain but found a near vertical drop down to the valley which no-one particularly fancied. Instead we carried on down the ridge, the wind gluing eyes shut and forcing any misbalance into an ungraceful stumble. A narrow path was found at the far end of the ridge and this was followed until the shelter of the valley floor was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2774957863"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn Iutharn Mhor and the Ey" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3028/2774957863_5131fc4d60_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a huge relief to get out of the wind and even the sun was now shining through the moving clouds. Waterproofs at last were removed and the final part of the walk commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked through the heather, glorious in its bright purple guise, along a fun track that wound its way besides the swift waters of the the Ey. In a copse of strangled pines we came across the ruins of Altanour Lodge where we paused again for our final mug of tea and a bite to eat. Two other pairs of walkers came off An Socach and headed out to Inverey in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2775801368"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summer in Glen Ey" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/2775801368_fbce29727b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our walk out of Glen Ey to Inverey was largely uneventful. We had a further light shower of rain, but no detour was made to the Colonel’s Bed and we reached the coach around about 5pm. After collecting Superman we headed down the road to the Inver Hotel where friendly pints were enjoyed by all and delicious looking chips were enjoyed by one.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Culardoch and Carn Liath</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/07/culardoch-and-carn-liath/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-15T20:46:46+01:00</published><updated>2008-07-15T20:46:46+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-07-15:/blog/2008/07/culardoch-and-carn-liath/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For once I was actually at the rendezvous point before Dave, who in turn arrived a fair amount of time before the driver of our bus out to Braemar.

Despite leaving Aberdeen slightly late we made good time along the quiet North Deeside road and after dropping off the lady with the lamp in Ballater were soon looking out for our stop just before the Inver Hotel. For anyone attempting to do this the best thing to look out for is the large green sign on the south side the road advertising the hotel ahead. Leave the bus here and backtrack a short distance to where a green Scottish Right of Way sign is located on the north side.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We left the A93 at the sign and headed up a narrow farm track to Tullochcoy, turning left in the jumbled farmyard and striking a faint track up through fields, then a boggy wood before finding a more definite landrover track higher up on the lower, south-western slopes of Leac Ghorm. This climbed gradually up onto moorland with the heather resplendent in its bright purple summer guise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2666883163"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summer in the Highlands" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3138/2666883163_699aa3070c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views opened up with Lochnagar behind us, then Morrone and the other foothills of the Cairngorms rising up towards the Ben Avon plateau to the west. We could also see a distinct line of hills in front of us with the speck of a cairn giving us a good point to head towards. This was Bad nan Cuileag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667038737"&gt;&lt;img alt="pano2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3031/2667038737_a767e0439c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed the track a good way up the hill before leaving it to take a more direct bearing towards our first target, Culardoch. At 900m this isn’t far off being a fully fledged Munro but it wasn’t until we crested the first hill that we saw its domed shape in front of us. Between the hill and us lay a boggy plateau which we wound our way across before contouring around a shallow peaty rise to meet a second more distinct track which wound around the base of Cullardoch on its eastern side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing this brought me close to small family of rabbits as well as a few surprised grouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667716938"&gt;&lt;img alt="Culardoch" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3161/2667716938_aeff06a323_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After jumping a ditch we took a direct route up the steep sides of hill, reaching the lower end of the summit dome after 15 minutes of hard climbing. From here it was a short walk up the more gentle rise to the trig point. Around us ravens swept by on the stiff, cold breeze that was blowing in from the west. We paused only briefly on the summit, admiring the views and then dropped down towards the west, to the Bealach between Culardoch and Carn Liath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667798328"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Ben Avon Plateau" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3126/2667798328_f6df1e911a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part way down we found a more sheltered spot away from the wind and paused for a bite of lunch. It was then on, across the Bealach with its experimental station (wire cages protecting the flora from the fauna) and down towards the hut below Carn Liath. Before reaching it we again turned off the path and made for a direct line towards the summit. The going was mainly grassy with the occasional patch of broken rocks to slide across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit itself was rocky with a decent sized cairn raised. From here we enjoyed excellent views of the cliffs on Beinn a’Bhuird and the strange tors on Ben Avon. To the south we could now see down Glen Clunie towards Glenshee with the paraphernalia on the Cairnwell visible against the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667745824"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn Liath Summit" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3229/2667745824_01b372306a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance too was our final target of the day, Carn na Drochaide. Between it and us though lay a fair few miles of trackless moorland with a few smaller hills and glens to navigate across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set off passing below the western summit of Carn Liath and then walking around the lid of its south corrie. We then passed to the south of Creag an Dail Bheag and descended down to the river between Meall Glasail Beag and Carn na Craoibhe Seileich. Sheltered here, we paused to admire the beautiful remoteness of this area. The gulch between Carn Liath and Ben Avon was dramatic and offered enticing views up Glen Gairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667752738"&gt;&lt;img alt="Steep-sided valley east of Ben Avon" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2667752738_61167ec780_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we ascended Carn na Craoibhe Seileich to find a large boulder at its 726m summit. We now had views onto the wild cliffs and corries of Beinn a' Bhuird. The Sneck was not quite visible, hidden behind the broad shoulder of Ben Avon. Crossing the plateau we reached Meall an t-Slugain which offered a great view of Carn na Drochaide. Unfortunately we now had to descend into Gleann an t-Slugain which we did by a steep drop down a heather bank, avoiding the crags to the north, and then down a gully past the Secret Howff where we stopped to enjoy some afternoon sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2667760828"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from the Secret Howff to Carn na Drochaide" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3197/2667760828_cffb4f03fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the buses back to Aberdeen less than convenient we now had to make the difficult decision to leave Carn na Drochaide for another day and instead headed out towards Invercauld and the A93 at Keiloch. It was a fairly uneventful walk back with Lochnagar ever before us, and bikes, landrovers and mysterious noises ever behind us. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry><entry><title>Ben Avon (Ben A'an)</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/05/2008-05-11-ben-avon-ben-aan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-11T22:11:30+01:00</published><updated>2008-05-11T22:11:30+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-05-11:/blog/2008/05/2008-05-11-ben-avon-ben-aan/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags: munro

&lt;p&gt;The Munroists began with a walk through Gleann an t-Slugain, moving from a broad landrover track up to a narrow path through jumbled rocks, chattering waterfalls and scree slopes. Here the going was good, although the mugginess in the air soon drove the layers off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea was taken at the head of the glen, sitting amongst the tumbled rocks surrounding the ruin which proved to be an atmospheric sight between the mist shrouded hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2487366216"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1150181_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3225/2487366216_136c064529_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we picked our way around a broad glen which had views over to the increasingly wild slopes of Beinn A’ Bhuird. Hopes were high at this time as it seemed the clouds might finally lift and now the streams, swollen by melting snow, seemed the only obstacle between us and the summit of Ben Avon. One of these in particular was quite a torrent and more than a few people got damp feet as they picked their way across the slippery rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now our way led up the deep glen between Ben Avon and Beinn A’ Bhuird, following the Glas Allt Mor which still had deep snow covering its course. Lunch was taken at the top of this long slope at the Sneck where as sandwiches were consumed, the spectacular cliffs of Beinn A’ Bhuird’s eastern corrie emerged from the swirling clouds. To our east, the flanks of Ben Avon clung on to their covering of cloud, the near edge of the summit plateau a guessed-at point somewhere above us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2486589177"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1150199_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/2486589177_bbb5e96e19_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half an hour after leaving the Sneck, picking our way up the scree covered slopes of the mountain, we emerged onto the vast plateau, a strange high land of undulating hills capped with great granite tors. Across the wild slopes, populated only by the &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2486608279/"&gt;Ptarmigan&lt;/a&gt; it seemed, was the tallest tor of all; the summit of Ben Avon. Measured at 1171m high, to be officially bagged the last few meters up the tor have to be climbed. Luckily it was only a short scramble up the coarse rocks to catch the view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2485968336"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Ben A'an" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3136/2485968336_607d87149c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here above the clouds it was a beautiful day and it took some effort to dissuade people from lying back on the warm rock and soaking up some rays. With another ten miles between us and the pub there wasn’t time for excessive stoppages and so we headed off, now crossing the plateau, winding our way between peaks and tors, sliding down a steep, snow covered slope and taking in the fine vistas of this grand area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2487517630"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1150244_b.jpg" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3090/2487517630_dd4f373305_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our way led us to the northern slopes of the Ben Avon plateau where far below we could discern the fine house at Inchrory besides the broad waters of the Avon. It was a steep and knee-knackering descent down a stalkers track, amidst stone and heather, which brought us to the waterside where a final tea break was held. Here Doug threatened to report us to the Mountain Council for Scotland, claiming cruelty to hillwalkers and a dangerously low number of tea breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a broad track in front of us and the promise of a pub, the last half dozen miles were covered at a good pace, the land becoming increasingly more civilised as we made our way alongside the River Don, eventually trudging our way down the tarmac road to where the coach waited close to Corgoff Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who arrived first discarded boots and made their way up the hill to the Allargue Arms for their well deserved pintage, whilst the rear guard took the bus. By any reckoning, whether high or low, Munro or not, it had been a long but rewarding day.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead the true irony of the British weather was found when it turned out that Saturday was to be a perfect winter's day: cold, crisp and clear. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2188695877/"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1120575" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2230/2188695877_ca567401a5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 7am I jumped out of bed, hurriedly made some sandwiches and a flask of tea before heading down into Aberdeen to catch the 7:45am bus heading up Deeside to Braemar. The journey was great, the sun rising over Aberdeen as we left the city and then breaking through some cloud as we got further south. After Aboyne the majestic summit of Lochnagar and its corrie could be seen catching the sun and then we were heading into Braemar, surrounded by peaks and covered in a blanket of snow. It was a christmas card scene after scene that met me as I had a wander through the village streets. The churchyard in particular was a stunning sight with the snow as yet largely untrodden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then headed up Chapel Brae to the duckpond at the extreme west of the village where the climb was the begin. Though much of the pond was frozen over the ducks seemed to be making of the most of what water remained to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the climb headed up a public road, past a white cottage and up to a viewing point where a stone held a mountain indicator showing the various surrounding peaks. At least it would if it didn't have a thick layer of ice covering it. The climb then started in earnest, heading up the steep northeastern shoulder of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrone"&gt;Morrone&lt;/a&gt; which at 2,815ft is not quite a Munro. It was steep going but there was a good trail to follow with other people having already got through the snow. That was all good until I decided to leave the main trail and head my own way up on what appeared a more direct route to the summit. Again I managed to pick up someone else's track and this gave me plenty of footholds on the way up the steepest section. It was a bit of a scramble near the top where the snow had frozen making it tricker to get grip, but that section was only a few feet and I was soon on the broad plateau that led up to the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2189587114/"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1120639" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2278/2189587114_dd45cb6352_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, back in the sunshine it was much warmer and I struck out west towards the top of the climb, taking time to pause and take in the magnificent views that had opened up around me. Behind I could see the village of Braemar surrounded by its hills, and in the west I could see the major section of the Cairngorm with Ben Macdui making its presence felt as it emerged out of some passing cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I passed a line of cairns and ahead of me could see the radio mast which marked the peak. It was another halfmile or so through a snow covered boulder field where the only tracks were those of mountain goats. Behind me another solo walker followed my footsteps as I wove my way towards the top. It was all worth it though as I arrived at the weather station and could pause to catch my breath and take in the magnificent views all around. It was something else, and as I stood sipping hot tea from my flask I was able to appreciate the Cairngorms in all their wintery splendour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2189201233/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit Vista" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2265/2189201233_a9573f1a3f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fifteen or so minutes on the summit I headed south, following a clear landrover track across the white plateau. It was very icy on the track itself so I walked through the snow along the side of it. I was now heading towards the Cairnwell and Glenshee although after a half mile I turned east , crossing a second small peak before starting the descent, now with Morrone on my left hand side. The way was clear, winding its way down the side of the mountain before joining the route of a small burn as it headed down to the Water of Clunie. At every turn new and more amazing vistas opened up, particularly as I turned another shoulder of the mountain lower down and could see all the way down Glen Clunie towards Glenshee. With the low sun lighting up the sparkling snow it was a quite breathtaking sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2190667534/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Clunie" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2004/2190667534_1b00c424b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track arrived at the foot of the hills where it joined an old military road, running in parallel with the Clunie and across the Glen, the A93. It was now a gentle walk back along the river towards Braemar. Just after the gold course I turned aside and climbed back to the mountain indicator, completing my loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2190928826/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Winter scene, Cairngorms" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2174/2190928826_0bd38cf57f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now a slight rush to get back down into the village but I arrived with five minutes to spare and was soon sitting on a warm bus, heading for home with sun sinking behind the majestic peaks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="corbett"></category></entry></feed>
