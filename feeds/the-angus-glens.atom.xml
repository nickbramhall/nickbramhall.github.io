Distance: 18.34km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,218m&lt;br&gt;

Hills: Craig Maskeldie&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it had been several weeks since my last drenching in the Scottish hills. Saturday rolled around and I had a free afternoon so the bag was packed, sandwiches were made and I was heading down the road to pay another visit to the Angus Glens. Around this time last year my girlfriend and I had enjoyed a wander down Loch Lee and enjoyed views of the craggy hills which crowd in around the Water of Lee. We hadn't been up the hills on that occassion (there was a barbeque to enjoy, after all) and since those views I had been keen to get back and take in a few of the summits. Although I have a long route planned out I ended up just doing a short walk today, mainly because the weather really wasn't very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxxrL" title="The Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Unich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8293/7622156058_c72acab5ec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I drove down Glen Esk in heavy rain, the road rapidly turning into a series of deep pools and streams. The hills were shrouded from view and I was feeling quite glum. Happily, after Tarfside the rain eased off and the views returned and I found the Glen Mark carpark almost full. There were kids running around playing football and the smell of food wafting up from the river. I parked the car in the last available space and was quickly off, hoping to get away before the rain returned and disuaded me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtRPo" title="Looking towards Glen Mark by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking towards Glen Mark" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7270/7621437416_fffca6a4a8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtSkJ" title="Garage Door by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Garage Door" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/7621439176_cf737fbdbe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I almost made it through the woods before the rain returned but when it did it was heavy. I stopped to don a waterproof and stow away the camera before continuing on. At the end of Loch Lee, beside the cemetary and ruined church I stood on the shingled shore staring out across the waters that reverberated with the splashing of raindrops. There was barely a breeze and clouds of midges were doing their best to withstand the downpour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtSUG" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8290/7621441088_7e4ccf7f8d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued and a couple of kilometres later as I passed the end of the loch the rain finally abated. It was humid and I was soon stopping again to take off my waterproof. This pattern would continue. After passing the Inchgrundle turn off I continued on the substantial vehicle track which parallels the Water of Lee. The impressive cragged sides of Craig Maskeldie and Hunt Hill dominated the views until they were shrouded in the next shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtUaU" title="Hunt Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hunt Hill" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7120/7621445334_c1be807767_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtUNY" title="Craig Maskeldie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Craig Maskeldie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/7621447484_c50d5af5f6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain eased again as I reached the linn where the Water of Lee tumbles down to the floodplain. Here I decided to stop for lunch whilst the weather was good. The linn offers plenty of interesting photos opportunities as the water tumbles down between several layers of rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtYxh" title="Falls on the Water of Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Falls on the Water of Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8015/7621460030_a0fc9144a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBu1uh" title="Looking down the Water of Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down the Water of Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8293/7621466584_dbe68e7552_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtXtb" title="Falls on the Water of Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Falls on the Water of Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7132/7621456428_9cc9ae2c71_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a sandwich I headed up to the bridge and crossed over to the west bank of the Water of Lee. A muddy track led over the shoulder of the hill before dropping back down to the grassy flats where it was now just a short walk in pleasant sunshine across to the falls of Unich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBtRjy" title="Bridge of the Water of Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge of the Water of Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7122/7621435744_65ed26f434_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxj6u" title="The Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Unich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7622111150_cb817e6e45_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure this is an impressive waterfall year-round but with all the recent rain it was swollen to a mighty roar tumbling over a shelf of rock far above me. Spray kicked off the foot of the falls catching the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBaDJh" title="The Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Unich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8152/7617884736_a34bdf7eda_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxvMf" title="The Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Unich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7622150460_09103a83e1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxwLJ" title="The Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Unich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7117/7622153794_8f667702ea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the falls behind and began to climb up besides the stream, following a track that zig-zagged its wayaround a number of rocky outcrops to reach a narrow valley nestled between Hunt Hill and Craig Maskeldie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxAdj" title="Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Falls of Unich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7278/7622165370_86d3a0d04a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxDtu" title="Towards Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Loch Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8149/7622176342_4cabbe1cc3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxJ2J" title="The narrow glen above the Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The narrow glen above the Falls of Unich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7622191668_c9278c2d1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gradient eased slightly along the valley floor but then kicked again as the narrow path climbed up to reach the more open moorland. The climb was fun but without any air movement it was hot and humid and I was ready for a drink by the time I came out just below the Falls of Damff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxMWQ" title="Hunt Hill and the valley above the Falls of Unich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hunt Hill and the valley above the Falls of Unich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8009/7622204840_ee6e2bfff2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxPuW" title="The Falls of Damff by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Damff" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8155/7622210066_8a71e30a1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track up here was very boggy in places but after passing the impressive falls, which again tumble down quite a height, I crossed the river by another estate bridge and backtracked slightly to get a more extensive view of the waterfall from the slopes of Craig Maskeldie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxSA5" title="Calm pool by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Calm pool" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8007/7622220456_416493567b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxTKw" title="The Falls of Damff by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Falls of Damff" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8022/7622224368_d52b6cf074_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now headed up rough, trackless slopes towards the summit of Craig Maskeldie. I contoured north and soon came to the edge of the crags overlooking the Water of Mark. A tiny spur led out over the precipice and I stood on the edge gazing out across the wide country north to the Deeside hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBy4eS" title="Towards Mount Keen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Mount Keen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8283/7622256288_119a2ff265_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBy6Ao" title="The Angus Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Angus Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8158/7622264206_caaa644936_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBy7vy" title="Mount Keen beyond the Water of Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Keen beyond the Water of Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7266/7622267290_1510ef8da0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was then a short climb up to the summit cairn and then it was slightly east to get the full views down the Water of Lee to Loch Lee itself. It was a little breezy up here and there were spits of rain in the air but I put my windshirt on and sat down on the edge looking out over at the views as I munched on the rest of my lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBxhUE" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7111/7622107158_429b450bda_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAoAC" title="Clouds over Mount Keen by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds over Mount Keen" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8284/7622711632_8df054b3fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The views came and went, across to Mount Keen which was rapidly attracting cloud and further west to Lochnagar and the hills of the eastern Cairngorms, the tors on Ben Avon a distinct sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAmx9" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7127/7622704702_0eb0f5e616_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun broke across the hills above Loch Lee but I was hit by another shower which got me packing up and moving on. I now bobbled along the lumpy, undulating plateau which marks the long summit of Craig Maskeldie. Initially I followed the leading edge of the crags, until steep ground above Carlochy forced me upwards where I struck a path winding its way on the firmer ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAqgQ" title="Loch Lee and Carlochy by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee and Carlochy" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7131/7622717270_53224c45bd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBArWs" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8431/7622722874_fe9734a14a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was back out and I thoroughly enjoyed taking my time on this stretch, pausing often to take a photo and enjoy the peace. Showers could be seen shrouding Mount Battock and the hills towards the coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAu2W" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7622729920_9d01994df7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAyj9" title="Loch Lee by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7264/7622744316_5e885ddcf9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occassionaly the track wound around a pool of still water surrounded by bog cotton and other delicate wild flowers. The extensive views across the Angus Hills were superb, the low grey clouds lending a sense of drama to this wide, rolling landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAFyb" title="Across the Angus Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Across the Angus Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8007/7622768678_67bc083de8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now just a short distance to the final top, named Cairn Lick on the map, and the point at which I would rejoin a landrover track to take me back to the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAP5h" title="The Summit of Craig Maskeldie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Summit of Craig Maskeldie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7118/7622793972_bdb7641017_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track drops down a gentle rib of hillside aimed almost directly at Loch Lee. The clouds now seemed to be rolling in once again and I was glad to be heading back down to the glen. As the track neared the end of the ridge it dropped off to the south, falling in a series of zig-zags to the woods around Inchgrundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/cBAUGG" title="Descent from Craig Maskeldie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent from Craig Maskeldie" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8026/7622812904_5fea838b11_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing the farm buildings I crossed the flats to reach the outward track just beyond the end of the loch. Happily it stayed dry and so I wandered back along the loch enjoying the views. A pair of fishermen were out plying the waters in a small boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the far end I once again paused on the beach, conditions much more clement this time. A breeze ruffled the surface of the loch and it looked like it wouldn't be long before the rain was back. Eventually I turned away from the water and wandered along the road to the car, to the drive home, dinner and a fine Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose it was inevitable that my run of good luck with the weather had to come to an end at some point. This was to be the weekend. After a cold, rainy Saturday spent in various coffee shops and the art gallery to get my long and rambling Ben Alder report written up I was determined to get out on Sunday, especially as MWIS had forecast better weather in the Southeast Highlands for the day. After recent long drives I tried to minimise driving time by heading down the road to my "local" hills in Angus and headed up Glen Clova to the Glen Doll car park where there is a good choice of potential routes and hills. As I left Kirriemuir and picked up the winding Glen Clova road the clouds let spill a substantial part of the North Sea and pretty soon it wasn't a road I was following, but a river. &lt;/p&gt;

As I left Kirriemuir and picked up the winding Glen Clova road the clouds let spill a substantial part of the North Sea and pretty soon it wasn't a road I was following, but a river. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the car park the rain had eased slightly but it was still the first walk in a very long time that I started in waterproofs (just a jacket actually as my planned route wasn't really long enough to justify over-trousers as well). I shouldered my ultralight daypack (oh to be free of tent and sleeping bag and all the other accoutrements of camping) and set off into the forest. The weather had the benefit of keeping the crowds away and so it was a peaceful stroll along the forestry tracks down to the White Water and across onto a narrower path threading its way between tall pines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7388201828"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud of Dreish" src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7240/7388201828_4b0a745790_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the track a bridge over the Kilbo Burn was out of commission so I got wet feet splashing through the stream. They soon warmed back up on the climb up through the trees to Corrie Fee. The rain had turned into a thick mist as I got closer to the cloud base and when I reached it Corrie Fee was largely veiled. Dramatic crags could be glimpsed peeking through the swirling mists like something from a lost and ancient world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7388283926"&gt;&lt;img alt="The White Water" src="http://farm9.static.flickr.com/8152/7388283926_b5951c862c_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I stopped to have something to eat. I'd also brought my Backcountry Boiler along to give it a test firing but sadly I wasn't able to find any decent dry deadwood and so failed to get more than a tiny, sputtering fire going with just some shredded paper for kindling. Next time I need to remember to bring along a little bit of firelighter to get things going properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packed up I set off through Corrie Fee and up the steep but enjoyable path which winds its way between the crags and waterfalls to eventually emerge on the plateau just a short distance from the summit of Mayar, a Munro. With little effort I was standing at the cairn surprised to find that the crags to my east were catching the cloud and so to the south and west of Mayar there was something of a view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7388333636"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Lost World of Corrie Fee" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8024/7388333636_3ee9e7c125_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn't really a day for hanging around though and so tightening my hood against the damp air I set off along to find the Kilbo Path and a descent route down via the Shank of Drumfallow. There were a few more people here (well, two) and soon enough I was back in the forest, slip-siding my way down the delightfully muddy track to get back down to the car park and a change of clothes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7388476486"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shank of Drumfallow" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8023/7388476486_d25b5cc9bb_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a great little outing. The dampness had brought a whole new set of sights and smells and the lack of people allowed me time with my own thoughts. Next time though it would be good to get a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Before Sunset/After Sunrise, A Micro-Adventure</title><link href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/05/2012-05-30-before-sunsetafter-sunrise-a-micro-adventure/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-30T22:15:14+01:00</published><updated>2012-05-30T22:15:14+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-05-30:/blog/2012/05/2012-05-30-before-sunsetafter-sunrise-a-micro-adventure/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags:

&lt;p&gt;I ummed and ahhhed all day on Sunday over whether to head to the hills for a quick overnighter but eventually at just after 6pm I got moving and after adding a splash of petrol to the tank was heading down the A90 towards Brechin. Temperatures in Scotland have soared over the last week and whilst I was turned back by snow on the Strathfarrar Ridge just 8 days previous the car thermometer was now holding steady at 25C…. at 6:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ummed and ahhhed all day on Sunday over whether to head to the hills for a quick overnighter but eventually at just after 6pm I got moving and after adding a splash of petrol to the tank was heading down the A90 towards Brechin. Temperatures in Scotland have soared over the last week and whilst I was turned back by snow on the Strathfarrar Ridge just 8 days previous the car thermometer was now holding steady at 25C…. at 6:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After a battle of wits with the satnav (which tried its best to send me to Brechin Golf Club) I was on narrower roads, heading past the Catherthuns, the site of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterthun"&gt;twin Iron Age forts&lt;/a&gt; above Brechin, and then down the winding, twisting route into Glen Lethnot. This glen, sandwiched by its bigger brothers Glen Esk and Glen Clova, is another spectacular Angus Glen, cutting into the heart of the Mounth range with the Corbett of Ben Tirran sitting close to its head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at the empty car park I was quickly out and off to make the most of the wonderful evening sunshine. It was that glorious weekend at the end of March when I last walked in just a baselayer as I twisted my way through the back roads to reach Aviemore late in the day. Here too the hills were lit up by golden sunshine and the river chattered away, very low in its wide, rocky riverbed. My ambitious plans to reach Muckle Cairn – a large, lumpy hill at the far end of the glen - by dusk were tempered by my later than anticipated start. As I wandered up the glen perusing the map I spotted a closer summit that should serve as a decent alternative summit camp. Cruys sits on the north side of Glen Lethnot and at 741m is a Graham top of nearby Ben Tirran. It sits above the wide expanse of Glen Esk with the view north dominated by the shapely cones of Mount Keen and Mount Battock, the biggest of the lower Deeside hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vehicle track winds through the glen with great views up the various corries that form the steeper southern wall. It veered off to the right to climb towards Cairn of Meadows but a clear, narrow path takes you forward through grassy meadowland beside the stream and up to the foot of a climb beside the tumbling West Water. This is a magical, almost hidden way of accessing the upper reaches of the Glen. From the zig-zag track I got spectacular views back down Lethnot but sadly as I stopped to take a photo I found that my camera’s battery had died – despite being at home all day I had completely forgotten to charge it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From this point on the photos are from my phone which sadly doesn’t do justice to how beautiful it was.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the climb the vehicle track is rejoined and this winds its way high up above the Water of Saughs. There was now a clear view up to Ben Tirran. Given the change in plan I started to look for a route up to the right to reach Cruys and when a sidestream crossed my path I left the track and headed northwest. It was a bit of a haul up through bog and peat hags but eventually I reached the fence and followed this up to the small cairn marking the summit. Recent work has been done up here and a shiny new electric fence is the dominant feature of this otherwise heathery hill. Ignoring the fence though, the main attraction was the splendid views. From Ben Tirran, to Lochnagar, to Ben Avon, to Mount Keen, to Mount Battock, to Keiloch - a great sweep of north-eastern hills could be seen, all of them resplendent under a dramatic evening sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I soon found a flat spot covered with soft heather and pitched the tent up so I could get dinner on and enjoy the sunset. It was idyllic. A gentle breeze was blowing but the heat of the day was still in the air and it was a while before I had to put on my puffy jacket. Lamb stew with pearl barley was consumed sitting in the heather watching the light change and the shadows lengthen in the darkening glens below my feet. The sun sank, clouds shifted and finally a red ball disappeared behind the summit tors of Ben Avon far away in the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retired to bed, zipping open my sleeping bag to create a quilt and lay back listening to the breeze and the chuckling of grouse and then a bit of an All Who Wander podcast. The light dwindled but it never really got truly dark. I slowly drifted off into a deep and restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My alarm went off at 4:05am. The pre-dawn sky was a wash of blushed oranges and yellows and above the bright stars were slowly fading into an indigo sky. It was a little breezy on leaving my tent but I soon had coffee on the go, sitting down just in time to watch the red orb rise from beyond Mount Battock and the hills which hid Aberdeen from view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/7303039910"&gt;&lt;img alt="Early light beyond Mount Keen" src="http://farm8.static.flickr.com/7232/7303039910_6b035a52a5_c.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a morning commute ahead of me I was packed and away by 5am, leaving nothing but a slight indentation in the heather. I had decided to vary my return route a little by following the boundary fence line along to Cairn of Meadows. On the ridge the going was good and it was only a short section of peat hags at the col that slowed progress. I paused often to watch the changing light as the sun rose, the temperature rapidly climbing. By the time I hit the flat, featureless summit of Cairn of Meadows I was back down to a base layer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I followed the fence along until I reached the small lochan, still and silent in the early morning. Then I traipsed through a final stretch of bog to reach the newly constructed vehicle track running down from the crest of the hill. It isn’t a pretty sight but it does make for a good surface and so quicker progress was made. I came back down to the top of yesterday’s first ascent but chose to follow the vehicle track back down, waking a few sheep in the process and enjoying some final views from this elevated position above the glen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I was back down besides the Water of Saughs and tramping back along to my waiting car. As the day brightened a clear blue sky stood out against lush green hills. It really felt like summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a change into my work clothes and a trundle back through sleepy Glen Lethnot I passed over the hills and back to the A90 where I sadly joined the rat race as it rushed into Aberdeen to start the working week. I always walk to and from work and so it was a shock to the system to be sitting in heavy traffic. Eventually though I was back in the city and after a quick shower using work facilities I was sitting at my desk with a cup of coffee and a bacon roll at 8:20am, ten minutes early!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure whether the driver was slightly masochistic or just trying
to acclimatise us to the cold we would face once we jumped off at
Tarfside in Glen Esk, but it was absolutely freezing on the coach that
took the Stocket Hillwalking Club away from Aberdeen for a day out.
Actually, looking back, “jumped off” sounds a bit too active…. I’d met
up with some work-related friends at eight on Saturday evening and
finally got to bed at four the next morning. I was feeling particularly
bleary eyed as I stumbled off the coach into the bright winter sunshine
just a few short hours later. Water would have been good at this stage
but already my hydration pipe had frozen solid so it was a cup of sweet
black tea that did the job of slightly reviving me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rickety bridge across the North Esk (complete with liability defying
warning signs) further helped the sobering up process and then there was
a little bit of navigation fun to find the right vehicle track heading
up the open hillside to the bealach below Garlett and Cowie Hill. We had
climbed the hillside in the shade, enjoying the views over to sunnier
slopes on the south side of Glen Esk so it was a great feeling to top
out into the bright winter sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we took a brief break to take in some warmth and admire the views.
Through a gap in the hills to the west we had an interesting view of
Lochnagar, looking along the rim of its cliffs to the summit of Cac Carn
Beag. Northwest of us Mount Keen had streaky snow on its summit flanks.
All the hills shone below perfect blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the bealach we continued roughly south following a good, wide stony
vehicle track that dropped down into the Burn of Berryhill where once
again we were in the cold shadow of the hills. As we climbed up over the
eastern shoulder of Knock Hill we came back out into the sun and with
hazy views ahead to West Wirren we stopped in a sheltered dry stream bed
to enjoy elevenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeling refreshed we marched on. Our intended route took us close to the
top of the Clash of Wirren, a dry cleft leading down towards Glen
Lethnot. Though we had debated about the best way to climb up to West
Wirren, on arrival the decision was made for us by yet another new
looking vehicle track that wound its way up the north side of the hill.
These tracks are far from pretty but they certainly made for good
progress and we were soon heading along the plateau. Here there was more
evidence of investment by the estate with newly constructed grouse butts
and strange markers, presumably to aid navigation around the network of
new roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track took us up to the summit of West Wirren where the small cairn
was briefly visited. The views had now opened up to include a hazy Glen
Lethnot to the south as well as the tips of the snow-plastered
Cairngorms peeking over the lower hills to the west.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track continued, circling around the rim of the large, cold corrie
separating West Wirren from the Hill of Wirren before finally climbing
up onto the wide plateau of this 639m high Graham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trig point is reached by leaving the track and crossing what were
thankfully frozen peat hags and bog. The trig stood in a puddle of
water, frozen solid, commanding views across the featureless plateau and
out to the neighbouring hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was about lunchtime now and we could see our next target, East
Wirren. We decided however to return to the track, thinking that it
might well turn around the hill to eventually link up to a track we
could see climbing up to East Wirren. It didn’t. We ended up circling
back, almost returning to the trig point, where we found another
sheltered stream bed to enjoy a break for lunch. Though the ground was
still hard frozen the sunlight was warming and sandwiches were consumed
enjoying the views out towards the hazy fields and rolling flatland of
the Howe of the Mearns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch our way took us through a maze of peat hags until we
eventually linked up with a track climbing up from Glen Lethnot and
heading up to the summit of East Wirren. Another cairn commanded views
that were getting increasingly hazy with mist creeping across the flat
lands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the south the march of foothills towards Dundee stood out only as
faint pencil lines against the grey-white fog. It was a strange and
transfixing sight to see, though difficult to capture on camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From East Wirren we dropped off, initially south but then east once more
to reach the Hill of Corathro where we enjoyed the last of the expansive
views before dropping off to reach the first of the farms at Little
Tullos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track led us slightly off course so we cut across via the bottom end
of a small reservoir to reach it again. The farmyard was a little
intimidating but largely deserted so we crept past the cows in the barn
and finally found the right exit onto yet another track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This we followed for some distance until we turned off onto a footpath
that eventually brought us to a proper tarmac road. This was followed a
short way before we took to the fields and hills again, climbing up over
a small brow beside a cold looking coppice to join a good straight track
heading for Edzell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the light faded we hit the main street of Edzell where the coach was
waiting for us outside the hotel. There was a warm and convivial
atmosphere as we enjoyed a pint or two and chatted about the excellent
day out we had enjoyed. By the time we stepped outside again it was dark
which only left the swift journey back up the A90 to Aberdeen, a fish
supper, and bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glen Clova seems to be the perfect destination for an afternoon walk. I climbed Mayar and Dreish late one May evening and on Sunday chose to use a free and unexpectedly sunny afternoon to visit the summit of The Goet/Ben Tirran, a 798m high Corbett on the north side of the glen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After leaving Aberdeen in glorious sunshine at 1pm, I drove down through increasing cloud and then heavy rain. Luckily there werenâ€™t too many Sunday drivers around so I was at the public car park across the bridge from the Glen Clova hotel at a little after 2:15pm and away up the hill just a few minutes later. At first it looked as I though I was going to get a swift drenching but luckily I only caught the very edge of a heavy storm that moved down the glen and out towards the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5595991329"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Laird's Chamber" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5595991329_999fd7f7a8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent path leads away from the hotel car park and up through the lodges to the open hillside. Height is gained rapidly and soon the views were opening out around me with broad Glen Clova running away behind me to the south-east, and in front the first signs of the hills that surround Loch Brandy. Over to the west were the line of hills that march up towards Dreish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5595991747"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hills above Glen Clova" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5172/5595991747_9bc47078e6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5595993527"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking east down Glen Clova" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5595993527_6f988104b0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I passed a couple sat by the path soaking up the views the gradient levelled off and I enjoyed the final stretch up to the lip of Loch Brandy. Here I was immediately struck by the very strong wind which was being funnelled by the slopes of the hills. From here my chosen route took me into the face of the wind and an ascent of the steep nose of The Snub which rises up to the west of the loch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596577528"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Corrie of Clova" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5062/5596577528_a2e5b51118_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the steep gradient gained me height quickly and I soon overtook a couple who were toiling their way to the top. The ground is fairly eroded and the buffetting wind nearly knocked me over a couple of times so it was a relief to get towards the summit where bizarrely the wind dropped off and I was able to comfortably walk across to the fairly substantial summit cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596580708"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cornice and lingering snow" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5188/5596580708_d0503d489d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here the views were fantastic, looking west towards a still snowy Lochnagar, Mount Keen in front, and to the east the long line of hills marching towards Ben Tirran. Equally the view down to the shimmering surface of Loch Brandy was superb, the afternoon sunshine lighting up wonderful textures, colours and patterns. I stopped to munch on a sandwich (very late lunch!) and enjoy a much needed break from the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here I followed the rim of the cliffs around towards Green Hill, enjoying the amazing views down to the loch and further south to the Perthshire Hills. Once away from the Snub the wind picked up again and I had to draw my hood close around my hood to give my exposed cheeks some protection - the wind chill was incredible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A path came and went as I followed the line of the cliffs but at some point I found it was turning away to drop back down to Loch Brandy so I left it and made straight for the small cairn on the summit of Green Hill. As I climbed higher again the views back to Lochnagar and the Mounth Hills were brilliant below constantly shifting skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Hill gives great panoramic views over Angus, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire, but with the wind whipping incessantly at my back I didn't hang around long. Instead I continued following the broad, undulating ridge eastward towards the now more obvious outline of The Goet. The land in between the two hills is very boggy and the only firm ground was where the snow was still lying. Eventually though I made it across the worst and picked up a track leading towards the summit of the day's highest hill. Unfortunately I missed the chance for a view down to Loch Wharral from the cliffs - something to do on a return visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final climb up to the trig point on the summit of the Goet was soon over and I welcomed the sight of a solid wind shelter behind which I could eat another sandwich whilst gazing out across Aberdeenshire to a hazy sea. It was great to have this summit to myself, the only sound the wind, and unbroken views in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596012107"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track up The Goet" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5179/5596012107_51ff834cd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a bit unsure of the best way to head back to the Glen Clova Hotel but eventually decided to drop down and visit Loch Wharral before making my way back, either by the road or along the hillside. I dropped down to the smaller summit of Ben Tirran and then followed a faint track towards the loch. The crags above Wharral are impressive, with a couple of waterfalls tumbling down them. I left the track and heather-bashed my way to the shore, disturbing several large winter-coated hares which skipped away through the undergrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596016401"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Wharral from Ben Tirran" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5106/5596016401_ae4c639560_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596600168"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Wharral" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5182/5596600168_8cde4044fe_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the shore of the loch I found a faint track and followed this around until I reached the outflow. This was flowing swiftly and almost dissuaded me from following the hillside back to the car, but eventually I picked out a good spot and got across without dipping my toes in the water. I then followed a track that contoured around below the Shank of Catstae, eventually meeting up with a boggy track running down towards Rough Craig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596603036"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Wharral" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5227/5596603036_36633a421f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than doing 3km on the road, I instead continued contouring around the hillside, heading back towards Loch Brandy. The going was reasonable with some boggy bits and couple of burns to negotiate. Eventually I climbed up out the Corrie of Inchdowrie and crossed the final rough ground to pick up the track which drops down from Green Hill on the east side of Loch Brandy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5596021911"&gt;&lt;img alt="Blue skies over Green Hill" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5230/5596021911_4d50185f6b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then had a relaxed descent, pausing first to check out the much calmer Loch Brandy, and then dropping down on the path I had climbed up, until I was back at the hotel and the car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a Cairngorm's epic on Saturday I wanted something more civilised on Sunday. After a lazy morning, a trip into town to buy a pair of sunglasses (replacing a set left in Venice last August â€“ Scotland isn't overly sunny!) and refuelling the car I left Aberdeen at around 1pm to arrive at the car park in Glen Doll at 2:30pm. The drive had been good until the narrow road through Glen Clova where I trundled along behind a Sunday driver who also headed all the way to the car park. Be warned there are some serious potholes just after coming through Braedownie - take it very slowly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501098174/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The river by the NTS Car Park in Glendoll" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3394/3501098174_38b2b73c28_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car park was bustling, people clearly enjoying the sunshine in this wonderfully scenic part of the world. I paid my £1.50, booted up (lightweight cross-trail today given the promised quality of paths) and was soon on the track to Corrie Fee (in the classic anti-SMC approach). For a low level walk in stunning scenery this route is highly recommended. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501126810/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The White Water" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3634/3501126810_3360b074dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burn tumbles and falls beside you, the birds flit from branch to branch and there were plenty of people out, families and groups of walkers. However, as I passed the deer fence into Corrie Fee the people disappeared and I was left gazing into this monumental piece of natural architecture all on my own. The path heads down to the Corrie floor but I sat in the sunshine gazing all around at the view - surely one of the grandest on this side of the country and getting towards Glencoe like proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500331669/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corrie Fee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3610/3500331669_b21757b18a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an excellent path across the Corrie floor which then rapidly climbs up past numerous &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501194496/in/set-72157617599228693/"&gt;waterfalls&lt;/a&gt; and views onto the crags. Out of the wind it was warm but twenty minutes or so got me to the lip of the Corrie where a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500389203/in/set-72157617599228693/"&gt;ramping, boggy track&lt;/a&gt; leads up to the summit of Mayar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500361383/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track up Corrie Fee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3648/3500361383_bce95ac444_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501182468/"&gt;&lt;img alt="South side of Corrie Fee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3661/3501182468_e3096f074c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the protection of the Corrie I was plunged straight into a bitterly cold snow shower which thankfully passed through as I reached the cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500398821/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow shower in Glen Doll" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/3500398821_c762665d9b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit there were magnificent views all around, from the rounded southern side of Lochnagar, the Glenshee Hills, Beinn a' Ghlo, and south across the Backwater Reservoir to a distant, towering Ben Lawers. Out east the coastal strip was green and lush and beyond it the blue strip of the North Sea was bathed in sunshine. For a hill that doesn't take much effort to climb, it has a rewarding view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501545842/"&gt;&lt;img alt="View towards Lochnagar from Mayar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3657/3501545842_0c5c0061bf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501232790/"&gt;&lt;img alt="View towards Ben Lawers" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3359/3501232790_1d80d0ee52_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501238082/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dreish from summit of Mayar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3411/3501238082_041152506e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As squally snow showers passed all around I descended from Mayar, following the clear track along the plateau towards Dreish. The track follows the course of a fence and offers views across Glendoll with magnificent panoramas east where the sunshine was lingering over Angus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500437569/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Glas Maol group" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3407/3500437569_e3831b52a2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501281006/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Into Glendoll" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3323/3501281006_aa1d77ea0b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me Mayar was briefly &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500446759/in/set-72157617599228693/"&gt;engulfed in a shower&lt;/a&gt; but gradually became clear. As I crossed the headwall of Glendoll I spotted a &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501290772/in/set-72157617599228693/"&gt;Ptarmigan&lt;/a&gt; on the rocks. From here there a couple of choices. The broader track keeps to the flat crest of the ridge up towards Dreish, whilst a narrower track traverses the coire headwall and is a bit more sporting. I chose the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500480237/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track across to Mayar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3621/3500480237_b474a540fc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501304626/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Dreish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3625/3501304626_c8ebd4df7a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there is a gentle drop and then a final easy climb up to the summit of Dreish, passing a couple of cairns on the way. There was now fantastic moody light back to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500497447/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mayar and beyond" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3568/3500497447_634dcda06e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit of Dreish is a wider, flatter area than that of Mayar and offers less spectacular views, but there were still hills and mountains stretching off in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501332678/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking southwest from Dreish" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3351/3501332678_c48650f233_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501340288/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Backwater Reservoir" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3501340288_13cfa5e1a5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the distance there were still &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500529609/in/set-72157617599228693/"&gt;showers rolling over Lochnagar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501352886/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Lawers" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3589/3501352886_e1e4db9601_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vague plan had been to descend by the Scorrie of Dreish but in the end I decided the take the tourist path and returned by way of the bealach and the fabulously named Shanks of Drumfallow Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501361340/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers over the Glenshee Hills" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3591/3501361340_608f02b489_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3500554745/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shanks of Drumfallow Path" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3585/3500554745_65f741e871_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This path which eventually turns into the Kilbo Path is fantastically engineered and runs down the length of the coire, gradually dropping to the tree line. The views back onto Little Dreish and the head of the coire were great in the early evening sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501548222/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Little Dreish from the Kilbo Path" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3414/3501548222_dc1c874de3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501392510/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Kilbo Coire" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3501392510_48e39ef237_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path through the forest was a delight, crossing numerous small burns and eventually returning to the well trodden route back to the car park, reaching it just before 6pm. Here I once again ran into people. It had been quite amazing that on two such popular hills in decent weather I hadn't seen a single person. Clearly starting a Munro at 3pm is not the done thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/3501401536/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glendoll Forest" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3358/3501401536_3bd6f382b2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive back in the evening sunshine was quite splendid and I was back in Aberdeen in time for a late supper.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry></feed>
