&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 17th May 2016&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 28.7km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,356m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Conachcraig, Lochnagar        &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny with a cold northwesterly wind  &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/195"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conachcraig always seems to have slipped through the gaps in my planning. A Corbett conveniently positioned above the car park at Glen Muick, it had previously been slated for an easy winter ascent. Latterly I'd been thinking about summit camping up there to get some sunrise photos of the light hitting the cliffs of Lochnagar. Now though I was looking for a straightforward option not too far from home and decided to put the fancy plans on hold and just go for it. Rather than the straightforward ascent from Glen Muick I deicded to try a different approach to the hill, one I had seen on a wintry daywalk a few January's ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I found myself parking up at Balmoral on Deeside a little after 8:30. With the castle not yet open I had the pick of the parking spaces and after minimal faff was striding off towards Easter Balmoral. The drive had been under overcast skies but already the clouds were breaking to bring some very welcome warm sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the South Deeside Road around past the golf course before branching off and climbing up the hill to the Lochnagar Distillery. Beyond this there was a stretch more along narrow farm roads which led me towards upper Glen Girnock. There were lambs gambolling in the fields and behind me the hills of Upper Deeside were catching the sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26489240273/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Upper Deeside Hills"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7767/26489240273_677184d80f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="682" alt="Upper Deeside Hills"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the farmhouse at Buailteach I left behind the road and after a little bit of heather wading reached the marked path that would take me over the low hills and across into upper Glen Gelder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26818887230/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="View back to Deeside"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7643/26818887230_e869ffea9f_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="View back to Deeside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ascent was a pleasant one. I was sheltered from the wind for the most part and the path was easy. Soon I was much higher up with views down over the desolate headwaters of the Girnock, distant Mount Keen emerging from the haze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27059916736/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Headwaters of the Girnock"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7346/27059916736_061d36ba68_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Headwaters of the Girnock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a couple of steep switchbacks and then I was bimbling across the plateau below Creag nan Gall. Ahead of me I now had sight of the Lochnagar masif and off to the left was the dark lump of Conachcraig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26818933220/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Distant Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7036/26818933220_65bf634733_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Distant Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path wended its way across a series of heathery summits before starting to descend towards the main track through Glen Gelder. Off to the northwest the Cairngorms presented a wall of dark rock and streaks of snow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26998741342/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Conachcraig and Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7608/26998741342_324f27f96a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Conachcraig and Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060003886/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="The Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7674/27060003886_9dc7a28b3a_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="The Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path soon disappaeared amongst the heather and rocks but it was easy to pick out a route down to finally join the main track. I followed this around the base of Little Conachcraig before leaving it to make a mostly pathless ascent of Caisteal na Caillich, the most northerly of Conachcraig's three tops. The occassional deer path provided some upward momentum but I spent most of the time in the wake of scattering hares, pulling steeply up boulders and clipped heather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26998788422/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Cairngorms from Caisteal na Caillich"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7115/26998788422_7f0df640be_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cairngorms from Caisteal na Caillich"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this top there were good views back to the Cairngorms and across to Lochnagar. Conachcraig's plateau had a clear path across it and I followed this across to the next top, labelled Conachcraig on the 1:50k map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27093017985/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7122/27093017985_608892643d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26489456523/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7067/26489456523_0f25d14ca8_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This top, a little of the track itself, had a number of interesting tors and offered an interesting perspective down on the very end of Loch Muick, the hills of the Mounth stretching off into the hazy southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26819094710/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Loch Muick"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7345/26819094710_ef33680881_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Loch Muick"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060102126/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Glen Muick and Mount Keen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7076/27060102126_ef440cc302_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Glen Muick and Mount Keen"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26819125400/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Towards Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7275/26819125400_079a94a6ca_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Towards Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a brisk cold wind blowing I was soon heading across the final part of the plateau to reach the high point and summit of the Corbett. Here there were fine views onto Lochnagar but I made the most of the shelter to have an early lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27093118955/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Summit of Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7784/27093118955_68d4b85694_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refuelled I headed down the clear, steep path which descends down to the high point between Lochnagar and Conachcraig. From here it was ane asy decision to forgo and early finish and instead head up towards the Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060222486/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Path to Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7559/27060222486_43e6cb56b3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Path to Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well engineered path males the ascent up to the col below Meikle Pap short and sweet. I was soon looking back to Conachcraig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26487829044/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7617/26487829044_b7daa4abe3_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once at the bealach it was just a short diversion to get the magnificent views of Lochngar above its namesakke lochan. A couple were sitting enjoying lunch in the increasing sunshine - one remarked to the other how exicting it was to finally see this view that features in so many books about the Scottish hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060285086/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7538/27060285086_8a2f28d8d2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a short break here, mainly to apply some sunscreen, before making my way up the Ladder. I soon was enjoying fine views from the top as the plateau opened up before me. Though there were snow patches round there was nothing to hinder easy progress as I wound my way around the head of the cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26487946504/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Meikle Pap from The Ladder"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/26487946504_276db28b44_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meikle Pap from The Ladder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060394196/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7730/27060394196_fd13568d7e_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were small figures in the distance - clearly its a popular choice for a midweek Munro. Rather than follow the trade route to Cac Carn Beag I followed the narrow path which sticks close to the cliff edge, enjoying the solitude and space around me. There were good views over the White Mounth hills though off to the west the weather looked somewhat darker and more threatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26999217482/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="White Mounth from Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7101/26999217482_bfe8055ed9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="White Mounth from Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26999254242/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7471/26999254242_07d1987f7d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26488110714/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7474/26488110714_d19fbd15c1_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cliffs of Lochnagar never cease to impress me and I spent a good long time enjoying the views from them as I wended my way along the crinkly edge of the plateau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26489875383/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7582/26489875383_3bb1222d1c_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060577706/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/27060577706_0fc6fa6044_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27025487681/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7370/27025487681_d1cd9684d4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occassionally there was a chance to peer down into the dark gullies, still choked with snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26490043353/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7742/26490043353_8e6fc42616_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26488377044/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7393/26488377044_f54ed7b562_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26488441504/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/26488441504_c88d22e347_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most impressive cliffs are those closest to the summit t the northern end of the plateau. Here rock spires climb up from the dark depths below and the dark waters of the lochan look a long way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26488488594/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7231/26488488594_029d864012_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27025695291/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7486/27025695291_28d1b268b7_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too soon though all the fun was over and I made my way across the short stretch of plateau to the summit tor, clambering my way up the gully to reach the trig point and viewfinder. There were excellent views off to the Stuic and I was glad to see that the threatening clouds were still far off to the west.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060887736/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Cairngorms from Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7747/27060887736_31dbc38c98_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Cairngorms from Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared the summit briefly with another couple of hillwalkers but soon they headed off and I had the place to myself, sitting in the nook of a rock with the sun on me to enjoy a very pleasant early afternoon snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26490267833/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Summit of Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7028/26490267833_18a10ed2fe_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27060991476/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Summit of Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7514/27060991476_aacd0454b5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Summit of Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time I had been up Lochnagar I had descended north, working my way back towards the old bridge near Kerloch. This time I started the same way but turned northeast to descend steeply down to the bealach with Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe. This would lead me down into Glen Gelder and back to Balmoral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27094045425/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7795/27094045425_9d75e7d4f9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent was steep but I made my way down carefully and eventually found afaint path near the bottom. This I followed up onto the rocky summit of Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe which offered an unusual perspective on Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26488876414/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="White Mounth from Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7218/26488876414_da70f543a2_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="White Mounth from Meall Coire na Saobhaidhe"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27026121291/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7565/27026121291_e2f37ca56d_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cold wind was still around and the blue skies were gradaully disappearing as clouds arrived. I didn't linger long and was soon making my way to the day's final summit, Creag Liath above Glen Gelder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/26820356020/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/26820356020_a6e87816b4_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27000154542/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7298/27000154542_220a47d1d9_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Conachcraig"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here there were good views north to the Cairngorms. I enjoyed these last few minutes of hilltop air before making my way down the day's steepest slope and into Glen Gelder. I aimed for the landrover track coming up from Gelder Shiel and was glad when the steep slope finally eased. The blue skies seemed to be lingering over Glen Gelder and I enjoyed the views back to Conachcraig and Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27026260521/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Descent into Glen Gelder"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7451/27026260521_00f059d3d5_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Descent into Glen Gelder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27094379775/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Gelder Water and Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7252/27094379775_f292f711eb_b.jpg" width="1024" height="683" alt="Gelder Water and Lochnagar"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once on the track it was an easy stroll back along through the glen, pausing briefly at Gelder Shiel to peer in through the bothy window. A little further on two guys were undertaking repairs or upgrades to the landrover track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/27094502985/in/album-72157668264855191/" title="Lochnagar from Glen Gelder"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7392/27094502985_c126c68885_b.jpg" width="1024" height="576" alt="Lochnagar from Glen Gelder"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down in the glen it was much warmer and I shed a couple of layers for the long but enjoyable walk out to Balmoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 20th February 2016&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 23.9km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 862m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Tom's Cairn, Peter Hill      &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Sunny with a strong westerly wind and occassional snow shower&lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/440"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than a stroll on the North York Moors at Christmas and a quick wander around Glencoe Lochan back in January I've had a fairly quiet winter walking wise. Weather and general busyness have both got in the way of outings and so this weekend I was determined to get out into the countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make it easier I headed just a few miles outside of Aberdeen to the small village of Finzean on Feughside. This sits between Deeside and the eastern end of the Mounth hills. The last time I'd been there it had been a dire January day when an easy sounding stroll up Peter Hill turned into an Arctic epic as high winds and snow forced us to beat a hasty retreat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time the conditions looked somewhat calmer and I put together a pleasant circuit taking in a hill on each side of the Feugh with some forest walking and using minor farm lanes to complete the loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25038388932/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Across Feughside"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/25038388932_0e13dc801d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Across Feughside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by parking up at the end of farm road leading to Tillycroy, a short way above the village. This gave me an easy start up the sign posted path to Tom's Cairn. The sun was shining and across the Feugh Clachnaben and Peter's Hill were streaked with snow. Further west the clouds were heavier and darker. The path was excellent, winding around the edges of fields, through a small wood and then up onto the crest of the hillside just west of Tom's Cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24526054054/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Below Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1551/24526054054_827911206e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Below Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grassy path took me up to the summit where there are cairns and a trig point and excellent views along Upper Deeside from Potarch Bridge to the high-rise flats of Aberdeen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25038497302/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1469/25038497302_574bd86aca_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pretty blustery so I sheltered behind the northern cairn for a quick cuppa, enjoying the expansive views. Snow showers were troubling upper Deeside and it looked like I had made a good call to stay east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25130480196/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Across Deeside from Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1509/25130480196_38a6f39bcc_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Across Deeside from Tom&amp;#x27;s Cairn"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Tom's Cairn I followed the crest of the hill west, ducking into Corsedardar woods where the trail was extremely slippy on consolidated snow and ice. I dropped down through the woods to the road crossing where a large war memorial to the men of Birse stands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24861246610/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Birse War Memorial"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1547/24861246610_fe20c247f8_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Birse War Memorial"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing the road I was soon back amongst the trees, wending my way along a series of paths and forestry roads as I circumvented Finzean House. Some of the paths were overgrown and at one point I seem to have dropped into a thick bog, but eventually I found myself on a good track that dropped steadily downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24861286070/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Woods near Finzean House"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1625/24861286070_309518ed54_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Woods near Finzean House"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached the minor road along the Water of Feugh and only had to follow this a short way before I spotted a sign for Woodend River Walk. This looked a good option and so I took it, intially following the north bank of the Feugh where there was evidence of some flooding and some quite muddy stretches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25156981175/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Woodend River Walk"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/25156981175_8d7fddf5a9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Woodend River Walk"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I soon reached the solid looking footbridge and Woodend and crossed over the river to the south bank. A short way further on brought me to a sheltered spot at a bend on the river with a perfect boulder to sit on and enjoy lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25157021655/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Bridge near Woodend"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1531/25157021655_ea1c25ec43_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Bridge near Woodend"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now followed the path as it wound its way along the south bank of the Feugh. It was very pleasant with sun filtering down through the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24861417660/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Water of Feugh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1450/24861417660_60a045dba7_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Water of Feugh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the path left the Feugh and started to climb up through pines, crossing the Laird's Burn on a rickety weir and finally emerging from the trees as it climbed towards the saddle between Peter Hill and Baudnacauner. The path was holding plenty of remnant snow and I made good progress on the firmer stretches. There were only short stretches of post holing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24526474294/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="The path to Baudnacauner"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1462/24526474294_6a62ec885b_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="The path to Baudnacauner"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me the views quickly opened up, looking back to Feughside and further off to the hills of lower Deeside. As I reached the upper coire I started to angle off from the path, picked my way across the Glaspits burn and then threaded my way up to the heathery bealach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24526499534/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Deeside"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1679/24526499534_20963b35d6_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Deeside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I enjoyed views over to Mount Battock looking quite alpine under dramatic winter skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25157226825/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1606/25157226825_351208592e_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a bearing across to the path ascending Peter Hill from this side and was quite surprised to find an interesting example of modern Grouse Hunting architecture. A hexagonal shooting hoot which looked like it had been quite recently half buried in snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24526556094/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Stalking Hut"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1701/24526556094_265752d753_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Stalking Hut"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the track led clearly up the western shoulder of Peter Hill and I followed it up, enjoying the excellent views back to Mount Battock. Views further west were obscured by dark grey clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25039006032/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1682/25039006032_6cc5d08c42_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Hill remained clear although the occassional flurry of snowflakes livened up the steady ascent. Eventually I spotted the summit in the distance and made my way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25039031582/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Peter Hill"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1650/25039031582_80ac12d73c_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Peter Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trig point and wind shelter were a welcome place to shelter from the wind and there were splendid views all around, from Clachnaben in the southeast and off to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25131018666/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Summit of Peter Hill"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1540/25131018666_2999157624_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Summit of Peter Hill"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also visible to the northwest under more dramatic clouds was the white fringe of the eastern Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25157407605/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Towards the Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1583/25157407605_791e1a4820_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Towards the Cairngorms"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a final snack and a few more photos I started my descent. I'd chosen to take a longer route around that would cut out some of the road walking later in the day. There were no tracks on the map but as I descended through the heather I quickly picked up a clear path that dropped me down towards the southern shoulder of Peter Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24861849650/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Clachnaben"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1516/24861849650_22b4691b89_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Clachnaben"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behind me Mount Battock looked like it was about to be enveloped by a snow shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24789817519/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1512/24789817519_63289fbf8d_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Mount Battock"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path came and went as I wound my way eastward. To the north I got a clear view of Tom's Cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25131191446/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Deeside"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1568/25131191446_48fd6eeda9_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Deeside"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to the end of the hill and then there was a steep descent down through heather, rocks and tussocks to reach the farm at Bogmore. It was now a case of following the tracks and farm lanes back towards Finzean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/24861895950/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Finzean"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1504/24861895950_acdaed6cac_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Finzean"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasant walk in the afternoon sunshine. I passed a guy repairing potholes in the lane and then crossed the Feugh for the second time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/25064321161/in/album-72157664204000479/" title="Water of Feugh"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1703/25064321161_4d3654a986_b.jpg" width="1024" alt="Water of Feugh"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of Finzean I picked up a cycleway that kept me off the road and followed this as it turned into a woodland path. I emerged on the road and then had a short km or so uphill to get back to the car, completing a pleasantly varied loop that had taken me from riverbank to hilltop all in sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="finzean"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="daywalk"></category><category term="dayhike"></category><category term="peter hill"></category><category term="toms cairn"></category><category term="feughside"></category></entry><entry><title>A Round of Glen Callater</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2014/01/glen-callater/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-11T22:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-01-11T22:38:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2014-01-11:/blog/2014/01/glen-callater/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A winter round of three of the Munros encircling Glen Callater in the Mounth area of the eastern Highlands south of Braemar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 11th January 2014&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 28.34km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,007m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Carn an Tuirc [Munro], Tolmount [Munro], Carn an t-Sagairt Mor [Munro]        &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very cold, snow underfoot, occasional cloud but mostly sunny             &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/221"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first high pressure system of 2014 showed up just in time for the weekend and finally I was looking more at the possibility of sunshine and icy temperatures rather than rain and gale force winds that have oft been the dominating weather feature of late. Rather than heading too far afield I chose to revisit a favourite corner of the world and take a stroll down Glen Callater which lies to the south of Braemar and cuts into the western side of the high Mounth plateau, angling towards the hills and glens of Angus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011 I &lt;a href="/blog/2011/02/the-callater-haute-route/"&gt;walked a high route&lt;/a&gt;, taking in all the encircling Munros (and a Corbett) that ring the upper end of Glen Callater. With a little less daylight to play with on this occassion I chose to settle for a more modest set of hills and, to dramatically mix things up, went for an anticlockwise circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive out was straightforward enough on well treated roads and as I came out of the woods near Dinnet the pre-dawn sky started to brighten. Across the Dee near Invercauld and the first signs of a light snowfall were seen by and on the road, and Braemar itself looked positively wintry. Lochnagar had been hidden by cloud but the peaks on either side of the A93 looked more promising as I pulled up in the parking area at Auchallater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9pyjX" title="Ben Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Avon" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/11909550115_803be3006e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quickly booted up and on my way, tugging down my fleece hat and pulling on a second pair of thicker gloves against the chilly air. The sun was catching the tors on Ben Avon away to the north, illuminating them with the most beautiful dawn light. Closer at hand clouds were moving swiftly in from the west and their underside glowed with the red of a dying fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9rvHt" title="Morrone by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morrone" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7295/11909931553_d32e114f0e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brisk walk warmed me up nicely as I followed the easy landrover track up through the glen, watching as the light changed and the sun got closer to cresting the hills. All was peaceful except for the tumble of the river which was carrying plenty of water and though it was mostly calm in the glen, the clouds were rushing through the skies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9sf26" title="Callater Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Callater Burn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2828/11910073863_a7843d2498_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carn an Tuirc, plastered in snow, appeared at the end of the track, and soon I had views of the other peaks that form the headwall of the glen, a grand cirque, impressive for this corner of the Cairngorms. The sun was now very close to cresting the hills and the light was glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way down to the end of Loch Callater and sat down on the shingle beach for a hot drink from my flask and a quick snack. A couple of folks arrived and left their bikes outside the bothy at Callater Lodge whilst I stood gazing out over the still and remarkably ice-free waters. It really has been a mild winter thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9umW5" title="Loch Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Callater" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/11910487344_6162149d57_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the outflow by the bridge I followed the winding track as it climbed up the lower shoulder of Carn an Tuirc. After avoiding the ice on the glen track it was now impossible to avoid the wide swathes of hard snow that lined the recessed track. Instead I headed up mostly on the heather on either side, taking to the snow when it was broken by vehicle track or footprint to give a somewhat more grippy surface. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the less than ideal surface I gained height quickly and was soon dropping down to the col before the real rise up towards the Munro. Here I started to get peeks of the Glenshee hills off to the west and also stopped to put on my crampons as before me was a vast unbroken swathe of icy hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9yCed" title="Carn an Tuirc by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn an Tuirc" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/11911319246_b1cff27593_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made slow but steady progress up the slopes, making for the skyline, and though it looked like the cloud was steadily building, was pleasantly surprised to emerge close to the lip of Coire Loch Kander with views of the sunny Mounth plateau opening up in every direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major change had been the wind. Both the glen and climbing the lower slopes had been sheltered, but coming on to the broad sweep of the plateau brought with it a sudden increase in wind speed and I was struggling to make progress into it. At this point a large bird of prey, possibly a golden eagle, came up from the coire and flew over me, quite close to the ground. I could see its sharp eye scanning the ground but was too slow to get the camera out and focused on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9uMri" title="Over Loch Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Over Loch Callater" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3754/11910569775_52496759a3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The going was relatively easy though, the land scoured of snow down to a very thin layer, and I made my way over to the lip of the Coire to enjoy the views down to the dark loch and along the line of crags towards the summit of Carn an Tuirc and, more distantly, Cairn of Claise. Spindrift was tumbling down the coire from the plateau, picked up and whirled by the ferocious wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9zP5j" title="Coire Loch Kander by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Loch Kander" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/11911550846_a55cee2a1b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way along the edge of the coire, climbing up to the first of the cairns on Carn an Tuirc's wide plateau. From here it was a difficult walk directly into the wind to reach the summit cairn. I soon had my goggles on and had covered every bit of exposed skin such was the chilling effect of the wind. The views were spectacular though as the clouds rushed over the hilltops, causing shadows and light and a mingling of landscape and cloudscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the summit cairn I enjoyed the restorative powers of an early lunch and managed to squeeze myself low enough down behind the cairn to enjoy a respite from the wind. Another couple came up from the west but pressed on, leaving me to enjoy the sound of the wind whistling past the cairn, a fine spindrift soon coating me and everything I was carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9BsyL" title="Summit of Carn an Tuirc by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn an Tuirc" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7296/11911872076_5061828644_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the short break I was soon on my way again, retracing my steps a short way before dropping down southward to the bealach below Cairn of Claise. The couple who had passed me at the summit were heading in the same direction and higher up the slopes of the neighbouring Munro there were more figures labouring against the wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9AkQW" title="Towards Glas Maol by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glas Maol" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/11911654354_fabcc2fc98_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned away from this Munro though and headed east and south, contouring around and above the Coire of Loch Kander with views opening out back towards Glen Callater and further out across the Mounth. The snow was still icy firm and I kept my crampons on to maintain assured progress across the smooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9zWoe" title="Coire Loch Kander by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Loch Kander" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2843/11911575433_40db4b4b73_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each undulation in the plateau my target, the Munro of Tolmount, came and went from view. The weather though was improving and the earlier cloud seemed to be dispersing so it was easy to maintain a bearing and negotiate slight obstacles along the way. In short time I was making my way up towards the hill's broad western ridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9Dviu" title="Head of Glen Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of Glen Callater" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/11912271506_2f1e00d7be_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final slopes were icy but easily climbed with crampons and soon I was at the exposed summit, the wind still coming in from the west making it difficult even to stand at the cairn. I headed north a short way to get the view down to Loch Callater before retreating off the hill to the east where a depression offered me some shelter for another drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9CfTY" title="Loch Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Callater" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5539/11912027934_67be49c9cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my resting point I looked northestward around the rest of my proposed circuit. At this point it would be possible to drop down the head of Glen Callater, following roughly the line of Jock's Road and thus cutting off a section of the high route. However, though Carn an t-Sagairt Mor, the next Munro, had often been shrouded in cloud during the day, it was now clear as the base had lifted slightly. I decided to continue on around to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9FSow" title="Tom Buidhe from Tolmount by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tom Buidhe from Tolmount" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7311/11912732666_2571f16606_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another long plod up easy snow slopes to reach Fafernie, a subsidiary top of nearby Munro Cairn Bannoch. The skies were dark and ominous, the wind careering into me from the left, but nothing much changed and I was at the small cairn soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9CYXB" title="Fafernie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fafernie" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2850/11912169433_579b7c95fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back the Mounth appeared as an undulating desert of snow with peaks rising up here and there. To the northwest the high Cairngorms, mostly shrouded throughout the day, were starting to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9DUB1" title="Mayer, Tom Buide and Tolmount by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mayer, Tom Buide and Tolmount" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3746/11912349894_dd5e5dddb8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed northward from Fafernie, dropping down into the slight depression that marked the bealach between it and Carn an t-Sagairt Mor, and then it was up the steep slopes of this third and final Munro with dark clouds looming overhead and the ever present wind buffetting me with every step. I was glad to reach the plateau and the pair of cairns and after briefly visiting the summit cairn headed north to the second, slightly lower cairn, where I sought shelter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were views all the way back around the circuit to Coire Loch Kander and Carn an Tuirc, to the deep trench marking Glen Muick and further off to the southern march of the Cairngorm hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dark clouds cleared, though Lochnagar remained resolutely shrouded, and so it was in sunshine that I took my leave of the summit and started to make my way downhill, following the obvious line of fenceposts towards the bealach far below. On the way down I came across the unusual sight of a piece of plane wreckage slung around a fencepost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a steep final descent I picked up the footpath that rises up from the bealach and paused to take off my crampons and shed a layer. Already, just a few hundred metres below the summit, it was much warmer and the wind far less present. I made my way carefully down the path, skirting patches of ice and looking out at the views over Loch Callater as the sun sank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9GpkD" title="Descent of Sagairt Mor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent of Sagairt Mor" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2834/11912836783_c68b61c98c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9FuTr" title="Loch Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Callater" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/11912660335_380047f466_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent was perfectly timed as though the glen below me was already in shadow, the setting sun lit up the hillside I was on a glorious golden colour. I followed the track as it traversed high above the loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/j9M7g1" title="Head of Glen Callater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of Glen Callater" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2859/11913754886_c75a609d5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of interesting burn crossings where deep banked up snow made it tricky getting down to the stepping stones that crossed them. Lower down, approaching Callater lodge, I found a nice boulder to lean back against and eat my final food. It was wonderfully peaceful sitting watching the sun sink down beyond the hills, the alpenglow stretching across Tolmount and Carn an t-Sagairt Mor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then it was a simple matter of walking back down the landrover track that I had come up earlier in the day. The sun had set and the glen was chilly and gloomy, the sun now only catching the highest peaks. I made swift work of the return and was back at the car just as true darkness was falling, the end of a perfect winter day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 12th October 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 22.67km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 980m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Monamenach [Corbett]        &lt;br&gt;
Weather: Cold and clear all day. Strong wind on the tops.           &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/407"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan for this walk had been a through walk starting in Glen Isla and crossing across the hills to Glenshee. Sadly our coach compnay, used for several years by the hillwalking club, went under during the week and so we hastily rearranged the walk to suit a car based outing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fine autumn day and as we drove through Braemar early on Saturday morning the rising sun caught the first snows on the Cairngorms. It was beautiful display of alpenglow. By the time we arrived at the hotel at the Spittal of Glenshee the sun was shining brightly and all looked pleasant in the golden glow of autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our route saw us following the Cateran trail from the Spittal south along the glen, threading our way through farmsteads and along quiet farm tracks with the views bright and sunny down the glen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoWBgZ" title="IMG_4864 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4864" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5517/10761325915_83a0709cd6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above the Outdoor Centre we turned to head up towards Loch Beanie, a faint track emerging here and there from marshy ground besides the Allt Mor. The loch provided a good stopping point for elevenses with the Corbett of Monamenach rising directly up from the far shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking along the beach at the head of Loch Beanie we climbed the steep southwestern slopes of Monamenach with improving views out across the Grampians. By the time we crested the subsidiary top of Craigenloch Hill both Glas Tulaichean, with its great eastern coire, and the sinuous outline of Beinn a' Ghlo, were clearly visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoTdX4" title="IMG_4901 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4901" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/10760665473_4040687929_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was easy walking on a narrow track through the heather to the summit of Monamenach, a flat summit with a few too many fence posts but excellent views across to the Mounth and down into the head of Glen Isla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoRcEZ" title="IMG_4924 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4924" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2822/10760270953_e7acb5338c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a strong bitter wind blowing we didn't spend too long at the top but after taking in the views dropped down northward to the shelter of the bealach before the pull up to Black Hill. We stopped for lunch in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoN3Tt" title="IMG_4940 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4940" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7408/10759656065_8415a31945_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoMQnC" title="IMG_4949 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4949" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7329/10759613966_62912b9f05_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There now followed a series of heathery hills which led us along a high route above Glenshee towards the top of Carn Ait, the southern end of Creag Leachach's long and winding ridge. The going was mostly good on short clipped heather as all around us the roar of stags echoed around the glens and up across the hillsides. There was a short section of peat hags and bog on the far side of Black Hill but progress wasn't hampered too much and we were soon up to the final top of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoLs4R" title="IMG_4960 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4960" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/10759343815_6df6fb4fc4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rocky summit of Carn Ait provided a pleasant wind break and we sat for a while enjoying a late afternoon snack with excellent views across Glenshee and the winding A93 road far below us, north to the Cairnwell area and across to the lumpy summits of the Grampians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/hoKPgy" title="IMG_4974 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="IMG_4974" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7357/10759220026_d47c460367_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dropped down, following the falling ridge down southward as it headed toward the Spittal of Glenshee. There were numerous mountain hares around, skittering amongst the rocks as we descended. We followed the new fence along until the point beyond Carn Chomh-Stri  where we could drop down to a vehicle track leading off the hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under beautiful afternoon sunshine the track led us downhill and back to the Cateran trail which took us without much trouble back to the hotel where pints and snacks were enjoyed in the oddly enjoyable surroundings. It had been a fine autumn walk with clear views and the other worldy sound of the deer roaring accompanying us most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 7th July 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 26.47km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,063m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: The Stuic, Carn a'Choire Bhoidheach [Munro], Lochnagar [Munro]&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Very warm with sunshine and incredibly clear views   &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/402"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There aren’t a lot of scrambles on the east coast but one of the better known ones is that of the Stuic buttress, on the north side of the White Mounth west of the main summit of Lochnagar. Whilst Lochnagar is typically accessed from the Glen Muick side of the hill I hadn’t yet explored the approach from the north west and so under sunny skies I parked up at Keiloch where there was already a busy car park at 8:30am on a Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing the A93 a small path disappeared off into the woods, leading me down to the River Dee where there is a bench and access to the rocky shore. After pausing to admire the views up to the Invercauld Bridge I followed a track along the river bank to the bridge itself, pausing to look up to the dark peaks of the Lochnagar massif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbYTQ5" title="River Dee and Keiloch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Dee and Keiloch" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/9313260336_917a24da90_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the river the various tracks through the Ballochbuie forest led me steadily uphill until the rumble of the Garbh Allt Falls could be heard off to the left. Leaving the main track I followed a small path along to the falls itself, pausing for a snack as the water crashed down through a series of rocky &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the main track I climbed up through the last of the trees until I emerged in the wide glen containing the Feindallacher Burn, coming down from the slopes below Carn an t-Sagairt Mor. Outside the cool shade of the forest it was very warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbZvnG" title="Track towards Feindallacher by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track towards Feindallacher" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/9313379910_22f1b3c2e0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a spot just beyond a new-ish tin hut the stream narrowed between rocky bands and I was easily able to cross, pausing near the bank to munch on a Snickers and refill my already diplenished water bladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbKmD4" title="The Feindallacher Burn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Feindallacher Burn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/9310618957_da22505cc6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was now a healthy stretch of cross-country, the going made easier by the recent dry spell, as I wound my way between bog cotton and rapidly dwindling stretches of march to reach the stream coming down from the Sandy Loch. There were big views back to the Eastern Cairngorms basking under incredible, blue skies.  With a decent track ahead I started to make steady progress towards Lochnagar, now visible beyond the rise in the land to the south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my right the Stuic Buttress slowly reared itself, hidden up until now by the land around Sandy Loch which I was drawing close to. I was surpised to see some substantial snow patches remaining in the high ground around Coire nan Eun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came up to the outlet of Sandy Loch, the surface still and wonderfully clear. The views across it brought me my first sight of Lochnagar's summit from this close north-western aspect. The track continued, faintly, hugging the western shore of the little loch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track left Sandy Loch and headed up towards Loch nan Eun and the increasingly impressive Stuic Buttress. It wound its way between boulders and across small streams where I was once again able to restock on water. Soon enough I was by the shores of this second, higher loch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lingered by the still, glassy waters for a short while, breathing in the quiet atmosphere of this almost unvisited place. I had thought about camping here the previous night but plans had altered. I think it will be a place to return to in the future. Across the loch the Stuic stood tall, its crags impressive and imposing. I knew there was a way up but it did look like the scramble would be a challenge and after some food I was keen to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc1ALU" title="Stuic from Loch nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stuic from Loch nan Eun" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3707/9313593188_8e928fae80_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned along the loch shore and picked up a faint track leading up the initial grassy slopes. The path came and went but it was easy to follow as it headed somewhat east, bypassing the first few crags. Eventually though I was up amongst the boulders and started to have to scramble my way up, following the path as it came and went between grass ledges. Largely it was easy to follow and I only had to backtrack on one occassion after coming up against a precipitious drop with the blue waters of the loch now some way below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came then to a craggy section where crampon scratches guided me up some interesting stretches of rock with a couple of big reaches. Adrenaline was pumping as I hauled myself up the final steep slab and then it was gentler slopes up to the top of the ridge. An excellent scramble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I topped out to glorious views all around. Close at hand was the Munro of Carn a'Choire Bhoidheach but I lingered for a moment at the top of the Stuic, admiring the craggy views along the cliffs of Coire nan Eun and back down the buttress before I followed the clear path up the gentle rise to the rocky summit of this most featureless of Munros.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the plateau like nature of this summit the views nevertheless were expansive and I spent a while basking in the sunshine gazing off into different directions as new peaks caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbMaSK" title="Looking across the White Mounth by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across the White Mounth" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5463/9310972971_f0082d0b7c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lochnagar was my next destination and I followed the clear track that runs around the rim of Coire nan Eun. Occassionally I would leave the path to peer down into the coire, getting a good close up view of the impressive snow patches, still lingering into the heat of July. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc2Aeu" title="View back to The Stuic by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="View back to The Stuic" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5499/9313786478_17806e0aab_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the track began to rise up the western slopes of Lochnagar and soon enough I was at the subsidiary top of Cac Carn Mor, a large cairn poised close to some of the most impressive cliffs and gullies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbMv5P" title="Track above Coire nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track above Coire nan Eun" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5531/9311037587_dbc61d0f96_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbMzea" title="Cliffs of Lochnagar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cliffs of Lochnagar" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9311051527_e8e1f387cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meandered my way along the cliffs to the summit of Lochnagar, stopping off to get some of the more dramatic views down to the lochan far below and back along the line of crags. It was a glorious afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc32sE" title="Lochnagar cliffs by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar cliffs" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/9313871342_57fa6b3d26_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I made it up to the trig point and viewfinder on the summit of the Munro. It was reasonably busy with people coming and going so after visiting the top I found a quiet rock to perch on and eat my lunch, enjoying the fine views back across to the Stuic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbN1KD" title="The Stuic and Loch nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Stuic and Loch nan Eun" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2841/9311137395_8234dd8261_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbNbLT" title="Deeside and the Cairngorms by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deeside and the Cairngorms" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5506/9311171107_bcb7e1bc01_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fbNdct" title="Towards Glen Muick by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glen Muick" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7382/9311175897_c59fc6bc0d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make my way back towards Keiloch I now headed north, away from all the traffic visiting Lochnagar's summit via the standard route from Glen Muick, and dropped down an easy ridge that gradually became steeper and more bouldery. Once negotiated I was on a broad bealach above Sandy Loch with the Stuic and Coire nan Eun behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc3yRm" title="Summit of Lochnagar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Lochnagar" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2863/9313976942_3e5cfdacb7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked my way through the boulders and then traversed across the upper Blacksheil Burn where I was able to pick up some more water. In hindsight it probably would have been easier to stick to the high ground and follow the rocky line of peaks around to my next destination but the dry ground provided easy walking and I was soon following a large herd of deer back up towards the ridge which would lead me to point 830.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area offered an interesting new perspective on Lochnagar and the ground provided easy walking across a few rocky tops before I finally reached Cnapan Nathraichean at the end of the chain of hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc3SHY" title="Lochnagar and The Stuic by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar and The Stuic" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7325/9314037066_74f9173329_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another down and then a slow ascent got me up to this final summit which offered fantastic views across the Dee and up to the big hills of the Cairngorms. Far below I could see Invercauld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc43cL" title="Lochnagar and The Stuic by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar and The Stuic" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7320/9314068954_686a5fe1af_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it was time to descend. I retraced my steps slightly back to a bealach and then followed a trail down beside a swiftly descending burn until I reached heather-clad slopes which led me down to the Prince's Stone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc4djA" title="Northern outliers of Lochnagar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern outliers of Lochnagar" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/9314102990_a18a229a07_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear track began here which I followed down the course of the Feith an Laoigh as it bumbled its way down over a series of little falls and pools. Eventually it came down to the pass below Cnapan Nathraichean. I crossed some boggy ground to reach the track which came up from Glen Gelder, turning north-west to follow it back towards the Ballochbuie Forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good track led me gently downwards with fine views back to the shapely peak of Stob Daimh and then I tumbled into the trees where the path became more overgrown but nontheless navigable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc4xPh" title="Stob Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stob Liath" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7328/9314168570_c6be234a64_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I was deposited down on the main track through the woods and followed this along to the west, enjoying the shade and slightly cooler conditions. I crossed the Garbh Allt and made my way back down to the Invercauld Bridge to recross the Dee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fc4E6E" title="Ballochbuie Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ballochbuie Track" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2884/9314189704_e43b8a8995_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clouds were brewing now and the sun was soon lost behind them but I was heading back, first for a coffee in Ballater, and then home for a fish supper after a tremendously enjoyable day and a new twist on an old favourite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 29th June 2013&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 28.4km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent: 1,240m&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Ben Gulabin [Corbett], Carn a'Gheoidh [Munro]&lt;br&gt;
Weather: Pleasant sunshine early on but increasingly cloudy with a bitter wind on the summits   &lt;br&gt;
Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/trip/205"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Gulabin is one of those hills I’ve seen a dozen times but always put off walking up it, thinking of it as something to save for a short winter day or when heading to hills further afield. In the end though I was casting around for a new hill and a glen that I hadn’t explored in a few years; Gleann Taitneach near the Spittal of Glenshee filled the criteria, last visited on a very wet day in April 2009, and Ben Gulabin would provide a new hill in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eYpTQk" title="Ben Gulabin by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Gulabin" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3821/9171023703_c3b8ac712a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving a drizzly Aberdeen behind I enjoyed a beautiful drive through Kirriemuir and Glenisla, eventually crossing into Glenshee by the high road. The morning sunshine lit up the fields and hedgerows whilst a certain blackness to the clouds led the scene a dramatic, moody look. I parked up at the Spittal of Glenshee hotel and was soon on my way, following the quiet road through the hamlet, passing wild flowers and enjoying the views up to the craggy southern prow of Ben Gulabin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eYBbw1" title="Gleann Taitneach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gleann Taitneach" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2889/9173226060_e647fda3f6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than tackle this steep side I followed the A93 north a way, avoiding the road itself by following a faint trail leading through enclosures and gates. The landrover track appeared around a corner and I followed this up steadily. The early start meant it was quiet in the glen and I enjoyed the sunny views up to the Glas Maol group, a hill I had been on just a few weeks previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unsightly new-ish track was picked up at the bealach and I followed this up steep slopes towards the summit of Ben Gulabin. Three quarters of the way up the vehicle track was replaced by a pleasant footpath and I ambled along to the summit enjoying the expansive views down to Perthshire. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had breakfast at the summit cairn and then briefly visited the east top before heading back down to the bealach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now followed the track north as it curved its way above Glen Sith and up on to Carn Mor before passing a hunting hut and depositing me below the southern slopes of Carn a'Gheoidh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ascent was steep but relatively short lived and I arrived to find an empty summit wind shelter. I hunkered down against the bitterly cold northerly wind and enjoyed the views north to the Cairngorms, east to Glas Maol and west to the Grampians clustered around Glas Tulaichean with its sinuous ridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhAbC6" title="Summit of Carn a'Gheoidh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn a'Gheoidh" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3784/9376728229_3c48927a77_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now followed the broad ridge of Carn a'Gheoidh westward. It curved gently around the head of a wide, flat coire and then climbed up grassy slopes to the summit of Carn Bhinnein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhQkew" title="Carn Bhinnein and Glas Tulaichean by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn Bhinnein and Glas Tulaichean" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/9379488764_1701525622_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a distinctive peak and was one of Sir Hugh’s original Munros on his 1891 list. Since demoted to a mere top it is largely ignored by those traipsing around the Cairnwell Three but is a fine peak with fantastic views down across Gleann Taitneach to Glas Tulaichean’s less recognised eastern side and up towards Loch nan Eun and its clustered peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Carn Bhinnein I dropped down steep grassy slopes into the narrow glen containing the Allt Elrig which runs into Gleann Taitneach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhPanq" title="Allt Elrig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Allt Elrig" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/9379260470_f1cc86dcf5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having a break by the stream I then followed a side stream up, following a deer path that rose above an impressive little gorge cutting deep into the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhNUfd" title="Gorge on the Allt Elrig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gorge on the Allt Elrig" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2851/9379209592_82bb0449c2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the slope eased I left the stream and picked my way to the summit of Creag Easgaidh. This led to a high level traverse of a series of tops leading along towards Loch nan Eun at the very head of Gleann Taitneach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhNtcU" title="Carn Bhinnein by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn Bhinnein" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5492/9379125358_be7cae9963_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way I encountered a huge herd of deer and spotted a couple of pleasant potential high camp sites with great views down Gleann Taitneach. The bitter wind persisted all the way along the chain of hills and I was glad to finally see Loch nan Eun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final slopes were gentle and soon enough I was by the side of the loch. A chill breeze blew across its surface and the cloud had thickened as midday approached. I ate my lunch enjoying this solitary spot and watching as the cloud lowered towards the Munro summits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/fhMsnh" title="Loch nan Eun by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch nan Eun" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7436/9378927426_b5082134d8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I could have returned via Glas Tulaichean I decided to stick to my original plan, returning via Gleann Taitneach. I picked up the track by the loch outflow and followed it as it descended past a series of impressive waterfalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of wild flowers out and as I descended the sun broke through periodically. It was warm in the glen and I stopped often to sit by the stream and watch the world go by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the narrow upper part of the glen it widened out and the path became a vehicle track. I enjoyed the views back up to the hills I had been up earlier and ambled along, the river growing as I went. I passed a pitched tent by a bend in the stream which looked like an idyllic spot to spend the night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Down in the bottom of the glen beyond the Dalmunzie it all became rather civilised with sheep in the fields and wild flowers carpeting the meadows down by the river. Eventually I reached the Spittal of Glenshee where the hotel provided hot soup and a cuppa setting me up for the drive back to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breathing deeply into my pile and pertex collar tightly wrapped around my mouth and nose I trudged up the track, following a single pair of footprints up the snowy hillside. The sky was a deep, unblemished grey, like that in a black and white photograph. I paused a minute and looked back. There was no-one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spindrift was being torn off the hillside and flung angrily across the path behind me. Footprints were being quickly covered. Still no-one. I half turned but then, shadowy figures, first one, then two, then a line of folk, emerged from the tumult. It was like a scene out of a polar expedition. Their clothing streaked with white, hoods pulled tight down to shield the eyes. We were at 300m asl on the side of a gentle hill in Aberdeenshire, just a few miles from Banchory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two long hours of toil we reached the 617m high summit of Peter Hill. A trig point coated in rime ice and a forlorn trailer hitched to nothing but the sky. In the teeth of the gale we tried to formulate a plan. People were hungry and, once stopped, found themselves cooling down rapidly. We sought shelter on the leeside of the slope where food and hot drinks were consumed with stiff fingers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A summit meeting. A decision, to head back down. Discretion the better part of valour. The next part of our planned route would be nearly 5 miles of trackless peat bog and undistinguished summits to get us to Mount Battock. It would have taken hours and with January daylight already at a premium it was sensible not to even try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/dLkMZs" title="Descent from Peter Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent from Peter Hill" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8362/8378068880_2011a6fcfd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the worn groove of our upward march we made a rapid descent, glad of the wind which was now at our backs. Without stinging spindrift forcing our gaze down we could look out over the stormy hills of lower Deeside, dark rolling shapes with white caps. Within an hour we were back at the roadside where we had started. Now, with the coach a few miles away we had to start our tarmac walk. Some brave souls dragged their feet all the way round to Banchory, some 8 miles from the bottom of Peter Hill whilst others stopped at the (closed) Feughside Inn to wait for the coach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a cold, long afternoon but eventually we were whisked away to a more welcoming establishment and were defrosting over a pint or two in Banchory.
It wasn’t the day we had planned but was nevertheless an interesting (and at times invigorating) experience. Just another facet of this long winter and one that will hopefully at least pay for one good day of shimmering, crystalline snow under polarised blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hillwalking"></category><category term="scotland"></category><category term="aberdeenshire"></category><category term="snow"></category><category term="spindrift"></category></entry><entry><title>Crathie to Ballater (via some hills)</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/01/crathie-to-ballater-via-some-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-07T20:04:02+00:00</published><updated>2012-01-07T20:04:02+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-01-07:/blog/2012/01/crathie-to-ballater-via-some-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 7th January 2012&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 19.43km&lt;br&gt;
Ascent:  562m&lt;br&gt;
Time: 5hrs 57mins&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Sgor an h-Iolaire, Creag nam Ban, Creag Ghiubhais&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the weather continuing to threaten high winds and unpleasant conditions on the tops, Dave and I decided to try a low level walk making use of the service bus going out from Aberdeen to Braemar. The basic plan was to jump off at Crathie and then make our way back east along the river to Ballater, going over a number of small sub-600m bumps that lie along the south bank of the River Dhé. These hills don’t really feature on any lists (though I’m told one is a Marilyn) so we were assured a quiet day with plenty of pathless wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the bus left Aberdeen a glorious sunrise lit the sky up with all sorts of shades of gold, yellow and orange. As we headed further west though we ended up under increasing cloud cover such that by the time we got off the bus at the Balmoral car park, opposite Crathie kirk, the sky was a dull, pale grey. After waving to a couple of policeman in their fancy Range Rover, we set off to the Dé, crossing it by the wide public footbridge near Easter Balmoral. Our way then took us up the steep hill to the Royal Lochnagar Distillery (closed) and then on a good vehicle track which led us to the blustery moorland below the heathery lumps of Tom a’ Chuir and Tom Bad a’ Mhonaidh. We enjoyed good views back to Deeside where the hills close to Braemar had plenty of snow on their southern flanks. Culardoch stood out in particular though we spent some time debating exactly which hill we were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6675391445"&gt;&lt;img alt="Culardoch from the track" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7150/6675391445_18172d2c0e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After passing a small shooting range the track gently climbed over a low brow which brought us views across the head of Glen Girnock towards the distinctive Coyles of Muick. Away to the south the Corbett Conachcraig was just below the scudding dark clouds which seemed to be lowering as we dropped through the small tract of forest to the ruins of the farm at Bovaglie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After nosing around a few of the buildings we had a sit down in the courtyard for a drink and some food. All the while the light over the hills was changing with rays of sunlight occasionally cast down between gaps in the dark clouds. Conachcraig appeared again from its cloud cover and there were hints of the grand cliffs of Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the farm we backtracked to the top of the forest and then followed the edge of the trees up some boggy ground until we reached the heathery upper slopes of Sgor an h-Iolaire. This diminutive hump stands at one end of a lumpy ridge which is pock-marked with cairns, some grander than others. Though only 544m high we still enjoyed the views out across the hills and in particular those towards the Cairngorms which were increasingly free of cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deer tracks came and went, along with some traces of a clearer path, but we largely picked our own way along the lumpy ridge, visiting each of the cairns in turn (though I think we missed at least one out). Once on exposed ground the wind was ferocious, knocking us around and making standing still to take photos very difficult. By the time we reached the final cairn the sun was well and truly shining and the views all around were glorious. In particular Ben Avon and Beinn a’ Bhuird were splendid in their white winter costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We dropped steeply down, passing through small areas of bog and scattered pines before scrabbling up the steep, vegetated cone of Creag nam Ban which enjoys a fantastic view over the Mains of Abergeldie and the castle there besides the Dé. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was again incredibly windy and exposed so without much hesitation we turned east again, cautiously descending steep and very heathery slopes to reach the quiet glen between Creag nam Ban and Creag Ghiubhais. Here, in the lee of the hill, we stopped for a well earned lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the energy boost we headed across the soggy glen floor, passing by a few toppled trees (signs of recent storms and high winds), and then ascended the rocky slopes of Creag Ghiubhais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6687221269"&gt;&lt;img alt="Frozen pool on Creag nam Ban" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7171/6687221269_d51d24dd8b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusually for a hill in the Highlands there is a wood on top of this one so the cairn was reached by wending our way through Scots pine. On the ascent there were glimpse of views back towards Conachcraig and Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the hills east ridge for a descent was difficult in the trees but we came out only slightly off course. A little bit of scrambling brought us back onto the ridge which presented an interesting few moves to get down onto a shallower gradient. We then dropped through more thick growing heather to reach the track that runs through Glen Girnock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quiet walk through the woods brought us to the South Deeside Road which we followed a short distance east until we took the turn off to Polhillock. This led us through quiet woods that protected us from the wind until we came down to the River Dhé, full of churning water and running very high. We crossed over via the bouncy footbridge at Polhillock and then paused to investigate the river monitoring station on the far side. Here the last of our food and drink was consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only a short walk to the A93 which we crossed and then followed the waymarked trail which runs just above the main road around to the crossing over the River Gairn. After this you cross the road once again and pick up a riverside track which took us around the base of Craigendarroch and into Ballater itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After checking the bus times back to Aberdeen we decided to use the hour’s wait wisely and headed to the pub for a couple of pints and some salty snacks. It had been a great winter’s day out. Though there had been the occasional spot of rain and flecks of snow and sleet we had stayed mainly dry and our route had kept us out of the brunt of the wind. Not having to use the car meant it was all very relaxed and the bus got us back to Aberdeen just after 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="201"></category></entry><entry><title>Snow Showers and Icicles - A Meander Around Glen Tanar</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/01/snow-showers-and-icicles-a-meander-around-glen-tanar/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-02T22:39:25+00:00</published><updated>2012-01-02T22:39:25+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2012-01-02:/blog/2012/01/snow-showers-and-icicles-a-meander-around-glen-tanar/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date: 2nd January 2012&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my car on the fritz and an uncertain weather forecast I decided to do a local walk to kick-start 2012. Mount Keen is the most easterly Munro and can either be accessed from the south via Glen Mark (the more popular route) or from the north via Glen Tanar (as well as more adventurous and less trodden routes coming in from either the east or west if you prefer). I’ve done both the northern and southern approaches in the past but must say that I prefer the delights of the Glen Tanar approach which also has the benefit of being slightly closer to Aberdeen and on better roads. In his Christmas special Coast to Coast from Aberdeen to Knoydart, Cameron McNeish came by way of Glen Tanar to Mount Keen and the time he spent there demonstrated the attractions of this particular glen. The estate are working to regenerate the Caledonian Forest and they maintain good tracks through the woods and upper, wilder parts of the estate as well as providing a walkers car park at the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sun broke above a blanket of clouds sitting over the North Sea I left Aberdeen, travelling down quiet roads until I passed Aboyne and wound my way down to the car park in Glen Tanar. I paid my £2 and was soon off. I was the only car in the car park and didn't see anyone for quite some time. I wended my way along the estate tracks until I crossed the Tanar and passed the small fishing lochan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6628201683"&gt;&lt;img alt="Right of Way" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7012/6628201683_19e1c6104c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest of Glen Tanar was wonderfully still, only the chattering of the river off to my left and the occasional birdcall broke the silence. With a firm track under my feet I made good progress and soon the sun had risen above the hills, bathing the woods in golden, wintry light. It warmed the air noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Tanar tumbled down a series of small falls and rapids I dropped down the bank to take some long exposure photos. Regaining the track an estate vehicle rumbled past me – the first people I’d seen all day! A little further on I reached Half-Way Hut, a traditional point to stop for a brew. With sunlight spilling through the pines I enjoyed the sit down and munched on some food as I drank a couple of cups of very bitter tea (never get distracted whilst making up your flask!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6622704521"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Water of Tanar" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6622704521_66cfdd25d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once on the move again I soon left the welcome cover of the trees and was out in the exposed upper part of the glen. Although it was still bright I could immediately feel the wind blowing into my face and could see impressive looking snow clouds looming above the distant hills. Within ten minutes I was engulfed in the shower. Though the snow wasn’t that heavy, the ferocity of the wind reduced visibility to near zero. I stopped to stow away the camera and get out my ski goggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6628760227"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cold Enough To Snow" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7034/6628760227_8e02e4cde1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plodded on through the snow, enjoying the bite of the wind and feeling the excesses of the Christmas period being blasted away. However, by Etnach farm the sun was again out and though the world was a little whiter, it looked like nothing much had happened. With blue skies overhead I could see another bank of snow clouds amassing above the hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6629224651"&gt;&lt;img alt="Farms in Glen Tanar" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7175/6629224651_8e49316382_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now had good views of Mount Keen which for a few moments had an Everest style cloud plume coming from its conical summit. At the end of the track I caught up with the cyclists who had passed me at Half-Way Hut (I guess cycling into a headwind isn’t much faster than walking into one!) They turned round and were heading back towards the forest (a good plan). I meanwhile crossed the new bridge and made my way steadily up the lower slopes of Mount Keen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The track was a little snow covered but the crunchy gravel offered up plenty of grip. I enjoyed the views down an icy Glen Tanar but pushed on as there was a chill wind starting to blow and the effort was keeping my temperature up. I made good progress and was soon drawing level with the grand northern corrie which you skirt around to reach the final summit slope. Ahead of me just for an instant I thought I saw someone but by the time I reached the plateau they were gone, engulfed in a fresh shower of snow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once out of the shelter of Mount Keen's lower slopes the wind was ferocious, blowing snow horizontally from the south. Luckily this meant it was largely a crosswind as it was certainly strong enough to knock me off course a few times. I didn't waste any time and was soon tackling the final steep pull up to the top of the hill. The strong winds had blown off all but the thinnest layer of snow so the track was easy to follow. I shouted hello at three people who were descending and then pressed on to reach the deeper snow that lay on the more sheltered northern side. Here the low temperatures had consolidated it down to a hard ice and so I put on my microspikes for the last few slithery steps up to the trig point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point I came out on the ridge proper and found the wind to be incredibly strong. Everything was shaking and vibrating as it ripped past me and a single gust would have me reeling around, struggling to stay upright. I ducked back down and half crawled to the trip point which I embraced like a long lost friend. After a couple of seconds I had had enough and dropped down to the thankfully sheltered north-eastern side where I could stop to catch my breath and look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6630523203"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Keen Summit Trig" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7170/6630523203_56e35b94f1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world was one of shifting shapes and shadows, half-seen hills veiled behind sheets of billowing snow. It was eerie and mysterious and I was quite glad to be on the summit on my own. Nevertheless the strength of the wind made me feel a little tense as I pondered my next step. Rather than face the gale back on the exposed western flank I decided to make a loop of the walk and drop off the more sheltered eastern side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6630572753"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent of Mount Keen" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7006/6630572753_3121abd524_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the snow was less firm and made for a quick descent down to the bealach between Mt Keen and Braid Cairn. Rather than ascending Braid Cairn (which I did last March) I contoured around, occasionally picking up a faint animal track which helped in the continuing poor visibility, until I picked up a more substantial track coming down from Braid Cairn and on to Gathering Cairn. I followed this through the snow-spattered heather until I reached the prominent cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6636696195"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gathering Cairn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7019/6636696195_94e5bb50d4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here again I was exposed to the wind but the loss of a couple of hundred meters had reduced its intensity. I stood and marvelled as the snow showers ripped through, eventually clearing to reveal Mount Keen, Braid Cairn and much of the surrounding landscape. To the east there were blue skies and the hills of Aberdeenshire such as Bennachie stood out, bathed in golden afternoon sun. To the north the far eastern march of the Cairngorms stood with Morven brooding under grey, sullen skies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time moving on I dropped off Gathering Cairn, making for the clear land rover track I could see winding its way below Clachan Yell and back towards the forest of Glen Tanar. I realised I hadn't eaten since Half Way Hut so as soon as I reached the reassurance of the track I stopped to have a sandwich and a cuppa. Behind me Gathering Cairn and Braid Cairn briefly made an appearance against a grey sky but as I moved off once again they were engulfed by yet another snow shower. This one caught me before I reached the forest but provided some atmospheric views of the hills to my right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back in the forest I was on familiar ground and with a clear track made good time. I hadn't noticed how much the constant wind and snow had chilled me, even through some substantial winter layers, so I employed my hand warmers to good effect. These, combined with the warmer air in the forest revived me and by the time I had once again reached the Water of Tanar I was enjoying the walk. As the twilight grew I passed the main house and crossed the fields to return to the car. It felt a very different world to the high, snowy and windy place I had been just a few hours before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixteen Stockets bravely set out from the car park at the start of the path which eventually crosses to Glen Isla by way of the Monega Pass. Though there was rain in the air, it wasn't particularly heavy, and the real problem was the ground underfoot which was merely muddy in places, but a true quagmire in others. A short distance down the path we turned left to climb gently up besides the north bank of the Allt a' Gharbh-choire. The path here was a little better, with some solid gravel underfoot, and so we made swift progress up besides a couple of impressive waterfalls and so further up into the mist. The line of the road faded into nothingness as our world was reduced to the few meters around us; people just a few paces behind were fuzzy shadows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6247341761"&gt;&lt;img alt="Waterfall on the burn below Carn an Tuirc" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6226/6247341761_df4c8d8822_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigation was made tricky by a proliferation of tracks heading up and down (and sometimes around) but we eventually came round below the steep northwestern slopes of Carn an Tuirc. Here we made the most of the shelter and stopped for a cup of tea and a sit down. Even at 750m the mist was already thick, swirling cloud and it only worsened as we climbed up greasy, grassy slopes to eventually merge on the rocky summit plateau of Carn an Tuirc. In cloud blown through on a gusty wind that soon had us sodden, we lingered only a few minutes at the cairn before turning to make our way towards Cairn of Claise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With challenging navigation conditions it took a bit of time to pick up the track. Once we were on it though it was easy enough to follow it through the bleak and featureless landscape. The only breaks were afforded by the glimpses of occasional pools of water or the call of a distant grouse. We struck the boundary wall and followed it along to the rocky summit of Carn of Claise. This is one of the less distinct Munros, even less so when you only see about 10m in front of you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily the wall provided a handy shelter for lunch. I took the time to have a brew courtesy of my stove and everyone was grateful of the chance to get out of the rain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Cairn of Claise we continued on, following the rugged track that skirts the edge of the Garbh Coire (you can see this feature in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/5487274744/in/set-72157626148931166"&gt;this photo&lt;/a&gt; from my round of Glen Callater back in February - &lt;a href="/blog/2011/02/glen-tanar-circuit/"&gt;read the report&lt;/a&gt;). Though the track came and went navigation with GPS and compass got us safely to the point where we once again joined the Monega Pass path. This took us towards the summit of Glas Maol which we soon reached to find there was still nothing to be seen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/6247851856"&gt;&lt;img alt="Misty summit of Glas Maol" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6119/6247851856_8e20d9af5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original plan had been to descend north and rejoin our outward route, but the weather had caused us to instead drop down more directly to the ski centre. A quick phone call from Cairn of Claise has rearranged our transport arrangements. After a snack on Glas Maol we dropped down by the standard route, steeply at first to Meall Odhar, and then more gently on the ski centre access tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we finally reached it, the car park appeared like a vast still lake, so reflective was the shiny surface. We crossed it and then followed the A93 north a short distance until we reached the bus parked outside the ski centre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short day meant we had ample time to sample the Inver which served a decent pint, a mysterious soup, but sadly lacked a roaring fire which would have both warmed up and dried off a very damp group of hillwalkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>A Wander Down Glen Dye</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/03/a-wander-down-glen-dye/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-27T22:00:08+01:00</published><updated>2011-03-27T22:00:08+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-03-27:/blog/2011/03/a-wander-down-glen-dye/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 28.09km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My plan today was to revisit a couple of hills; Mount Battock, which I climbed in &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/sets/72157611555166800/"&gt;November 2008&lt;/a&gt; and Clachnaben, which I have been up numerous times by various different routes. They are connected by an undulating string of flat, unremarkable hills that have been devastated by vehicle tracks and shooting paraphernalia which do not make for a pretty sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/aberdeenshire/mount-battock.shtml"&gt;Walk Highlands&lt;/a&gt; recommends doing this as an out and back, presumably for the fine views both north and south - of which there are many - but I didn’t think much of the trudge between the two hills and would recommend turning it into a circuit with plenty of different ways of dropping into Glen Dye, or climbing out from it. To avoid doing the unappealing out and back I decided to wander up the length of the Water of Dye and then return via the high route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5568807520"&gt;&lt;img alt="The track to Glen Dye Lodge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5109/5568807520_6bdcc1b4ed_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the Australian Grand Prix live and having a lazy breakfast I eventually got parked up at the Clachnaben Quarry car park at 11am (BST!). Under sunny skies the car park was already crammed full, but luckily my small and rather mucky car fitted perfectly between two very large, expensive and clean cars! Ditching a few things from the pack in light of the good weather, but taking my new &lt;a href="http://www.phdesigns.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=112"&gt;PHD Down Vest&lt;/a&gt; (packed in its stuffsack it is an almost imperceptible size and weight at the bottom of the pack!) I was away on the good track which climbs through the woods and then drops down towards Miller’s Bog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576204063"&gt;&lt;img alt="Woods near Glen Dye Lodge" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5060/5576204063_84e8f92998_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bright sunshine everything felt lazy and summery. Birds flitted in the branches and new plants were pushing up between dead leaves, pine needles and fir cones. The sombre brown was turned into reds and golds wherever the sunlight shone down through the canopy. There was a deliciously fresh smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5565222803"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben across Miller's Bog" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5291/5565222803_22125b5f69_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the Clachnaben information point a large crowd of walkers (a club? conservationists?) were gathered but I pushed on, and ignoring the main turn-off for the hill, continued on the broad vehicle track that now runs roughly south, following the wide river and running parallel with the busy Cairn o’ Mount road. Immediately I was away from the crowds and enjoying a pleasant amble, following the wide curves and bends in the river as the track contoured round below Netty Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576204361"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5305/5576204361_7bf2efd1cd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a junction a track branches off to the right to climb over a low shoulder of hills, but, wanting to stay true to my original plan, I chose the lower route which sticks close by the river and so adds a couple of kilometres to the route. Once around the corner you enter into Glen Dye proper with the hills now starting to rise on both the north and south sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576790762"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water of Dye" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5224/5576790762_f76f3cb169_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds had closed in, banishing for the moment the bright sun, but I continued on, enjoying the sights and sounds of a peaceful world. As I passed the unknown-to-the-OS reservoir near Charr I rejoined the main track higher up the hillside and as I did so was rejoined by the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576791846"&gt;&lt;img alt="New reservoir near Charr" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5012/5576791846_5dfc2a5f16_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The river now bends around and gave me an excellent view up to Mount Battock, with snow still streaked around its summit. Some distance on, besides a nice stretch of riverbank, I stopped for a snack and a laze in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576208593"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mt Battock" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5292/5576208593_751c745ab2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5569360746"&gt;&lt;img alt="Water of Dye" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5293/5569360746_159fd427dc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further on still I passed another derelict farm building and then came across some more recent signs of human activity. The river turned in a series of ox-bows and at each crossing point a fresh log stood with a small animal trap at its centre. I was able to ford the river at most of these but had to cross one where the stream was swift and deep. There were also sheep paddocks and higher up signs of some recent deer culling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5568219929"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Upper Reaches of Glen Dye" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5011/5568219929_7f91f1ac22_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough though, after following the river to its very head, I was climbing out of the glen and up onto the Hill of Saughs. Here a deer fence temporarily obstructed my course until I found a way across it and onto the main estate track which runs up from distant Glen Esk. The tracks in this area are quite horrific, built with no sympathy for the land. I followed its line up to the boggy bealach below Mt Battock and was glad to be rid of it as I then followed a narrow footpath up the slopes. There were broad streaks of slushy snow to cross and below one of these I came across a melt pool teeming with noisy frogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576210777"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Esk hills" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5270/5576210777_40697d5c5f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summit was reached in due course, offering excellent views west to Mount Keen and Lochnagar and further off to where the Cairngorms stood in a swathe of dark, stormy looking clouds. Away from any shelter there was a brisk wind on the summit so I put on my down vest and settled down for a late lunch in the wind shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5576796880"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Mt Battock" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5576796880_d989edec96_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After enjoying the loneliness of this spot for fifteen or so minutes I was ready to continue on, conscious of the distance back to far-off Clachnaben. The initial descent from Mt Battock is excellent with a pleasant track following a line of rickety fenceposts. Unfortunately before too long you join another eye-sore of a vehicle track which winds along to a newly built stalking cabin with no consideration for its surroundings. At this stage the clouds had rolled back in and the storm clouds seen over the Cairngorms were gradually drifting down Deeside, engulfing first Morvern and then Bennachie. It gave some dramatic lighting back over Mt Battock, and then rainbows sprang into life over the sunlit fields of Aberdeenshire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plodded on, following the twists and turns in the track which wound between peat hags and eroded hillside. Occasionally the track was covered by deep, slushy snow which was tiring to cross. Eventually though, after crossing the Hill of Badymicks, Sandy Hill and the Hill of Edendocher I was on the final pull up to Clachnaben. The wee scramble up to the summit of the large tor is always the highlight here and it was fun putting hand to rock and clambering out onto the summit to be greeted by a rainbow filling the valley below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time up on the deserted summit, enjoying the views and finishing off the last of my food. The showers passed across the lower country causing fascinating changes to light and depth. Eventually a family with a young baby came briefly up to the summit to take a picture. After they had left I began my own descent, following the excellent path down into the forest and then across Miller's Bog. Once off the hill I warmed up again rapidly and had to strip down to the base layer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief shower got me as I approached Glen Dye lodge but cleared in time to give me a great final view to Clachnaben. Then it was through the woods to the car, a quick drive home and back in time for dinner and the final episode of Wonders of the Universe. A great afternoon out!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Callater Haute Route</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2011/02/the-callater-haute-route/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-26T23:56:26+00:00</published><updated>2011-02-26T23:56:26+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2011-02-26:/blog/2011/02/the-callater-haute-route/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 32.97km&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its summit came at about the halfway point on a new route I devised that took me around the high ground that surrounds Glen Callater, one of my favourite eastern glens. I had two objectives in planning this route: one was to climb the Corbett &lt;a href="http://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/corbetts/creag-nan-gabhar"&gt;Creag nan Gabhar&lt;/a&gt;, which sits between Glen Callater and Glen Cluanie; and the other being to get a view from the Munro of Cairn Bannoch, something which I missed out on when was up it in &lt;a href="/blog/2009/05/broad-cairn-cairn-bannoch/"&gt;May 2009&lt;/a&gt;. To link these two slightly separated hills I had a long day that would ultimately be hugely rewarding, both for the views and for the distance covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Aberdeen at 7am, I was under grey skies that darkened and turned to torrential rain as I passed through Banchory. Luckily though, as I went further west, passing through the sleepy Deeside villages, the weather gradually improved. Although I set off under grey skies from the car park at Auchallater, there was hints of a brighter sky to the northwest and the weather forecast had confidently predicted sunshine by midday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5482981630"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5219/5482981630_691522b1e9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the usual route along the main vehicle track which runs beside the Callater burn all the way through the glen to the lodge buildings at the foot of the loch. The air was chilly, still unsure of what kind of a day it wanted to be, but the fullness of the river was a sure sign that the recent thaw had had its effects in the mountains. Gradually the higher hills, which crowd in around the southeast end of the glen began to appear, each one with a healthy covering of snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5482392363"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5259/5482392363_b47f91375d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a decent leg-stretch through Glen Callater and I was warming up nicely as blue sky began to slowly creep above the western hills. This was an encouraging sight (not that I doubted MWIS of course!) and sped me on my way up the stalker's path which climbs above the loch on its east side. Loch Callater itself was still frozen, the ice held in rich, textured swirls. As I climbed the sun was slowly revealed, lighting up the mountains and picking out the sinuous shape of the burn which tumbles down from Coire Kander and Tolmount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5479985249"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5095/5479985249_14317a7ca0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning the corner, I followed the track across several short sections of softish snow until I reached the boggy bealach below Carn an t-Sagairt Mor. I had previously come this way on another long walk in April 2008 when the snowline had been lower and the bealach had been buried and featureless. Now I was able to follow the track as it darted up the lower slopes of the mountain, coming to a stop only at the first significant band of snow some way up the side. Here I decided it would be prudent to put on the crampons as the surface was incredibly icy and there were no sign of other footsteps to follow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made the going much easier and luckily I only had to pick my way carefully across a few vegetated areas, trying not to catch my spikes on unforgiving rocks. Behind me the views were opening out, both to Ben Avon and across to the Glenshee Hills to the west of the A93. Though I was in the shade as I climbed, sunlight was illuminating the landscape all around, setting off the striking whites and greens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5483058634"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5057/5483058634_ac2837762a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the snow thinned and then completely disappeared as the slope eased off and I came up onto the summit plateau and the lower of the two cairns. I took off my muddy crampons and after stopping to admire the view back to the main Cairngorms, ambled over to the summit cairn for a quick sit down and a brew. The sky was still clearing to the east but already I could see the mountains emerging from the gloom of the early morning. It was a fabulous, quiet place for a sit down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5482472799"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5255/5482472799_93eedc24dc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this pause I now continued on my way, following a rough bearing south down another consolidated snow slope (crampons back on!) and around the lip of the gently sloping coire that drains into the Allt an Dubh-loch. As I wandered through this barren landscape, enjoying the views along to the Eagle Rocks below the White Mounth, I saw another solitary walker who had evidently come up from the Dubh loch and was heading towards Carn an t-Sagairt Mor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my steady way across the gently rising slope, my destination now clear in the distance. Cairn Bannoch has virtually no prominence from this side but was nevertheless easy to spot. All around me the skies were improving and I had excellent views along the White Mounth, including Carn an t-Sagairt Beag and Cairn a' Choire Bhoidheach, all the way to Cac Carn Mor on Lochnagar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came out onto the broad plateau that links Cairn Bannoch to Fafernie, and here I came across my first set of clear tracks. I followed these up to the summit and enjoyed a brief scrabble up the rocks to reach the sunlit summit cairn. My first objective, a clear summit, had been achieved and now I was able to stop for a proper break and take in the glorious views which extended out across Broad Cairn towards the Deeside Hills and further afield to Tolmount, Tom Buidhe, and the Angus and Perthshire hills. The clearing skies were spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some food, I decided to cut short my original route which had included the easterly Munro of Broad Cairn. The out and back didn't really appeal to me and so I retraced my steps off Cairn Bannoch but now turned and climbed up the gentle rise to its neighbour, Fafernie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5487045840"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5487045840_083529bedd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a brief stop here to look back across the Cairngorm plateau where all the main peaks were now largely free of cloud. The wind up here on the exposed plateau was chilly though so I continued on my way, following the broad line of the plateau which now loses a small amount of altitude to the area above where Jock's Road plunges down into Glen Callater. From here I would be heading up Tolmount to continue my high level route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5486468533"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5016/5486468533_ef317829a4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I was in a quiet world, with no sign of any other hikers anywhere. The sunshine was bright and welcoming, and the temperature just about perfect. I now had the short ascent of Tolmount to make. As I got higher I began to glimpse views into Glen Callater and to make the most of this contoured around onto the north side of the mountain to appreciate the grand vistas. The snow here was very hard packed and icy and I was glad I had left my crampons on as footing wouldn't have been great without them. After a few photo stops I made my way up the final few meters to the summit cairn, peaceful, sunlit, and the perfect place for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this break and a chance to remove my crampons, I made my way down off Tolmount, passing between to crowds of oncoming groups, one set skiing up from Tom Buidhe, and the others walking up after visiting Carn an Tuirc. As I was heading to Cairn of Claise I passed almost middway between the two of them, dropping down to the bealach and then taking a bearing for the summit plateau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5486548823"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5291/5486548823_cd7a01a804_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember from my walk across these hills in May 2008 that this area is incredibly boggy and was very grateful for the snow and ice cover. It made the going very easy and the distractions of the afternoon sun illuminating the lands down to Perth made short work of the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the line of the old wall, almost buried by the snow, and follow it up to the large cairn which marks the summit of Cairn of Claise. Here I actually spoke to the first other humans of the day, as three people had gathered on the summit, one waiting for partners to return from Carn an Tuirc, and the others ready to head back towards the ski centre at Glenshee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5486560713"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5291/5486560713_8c9e56da0a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed for some time, enjoying the views across to Glas Maol, and chatting with the guy, before making my own way off, now turning sharply to the north to make my way over to Carn an Tuirc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5488443134"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5252/5488443134_ec753b7dbd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already watched as a heavy snow shower developed over the Cairngorms. This first one passed to the north of me, carried on a northwest wind until it shrouded Lochnagar. I began to drop down to the bealach but before long a second shower had been blown in, this one making straight for me. Visibility dropped to just a few hundred feet and the world became dark and cold. Nevertheless the terrain wasn't difficult and luckily, as I climbed up onto the rubbly summit plateau of Carn an Tuirc, the shower blew through, once again revealing the surrounding mountains, bathed in late afternoon sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a brief brew and a bite to eat on Carn an Tuirc I now had to make my way to Creag nan Gabhar, either skirting around, or crossing the intermediary top of Carn Dubh. First though I had to get down the steep northern slopes of Carn an Tuirc. To do this I contoured around to one of the wee burns which falls down to the boggy bealach and there I (for the third and final time) put on my crampons. Initially the snow was very icy and I was glad of their bite but as I descended further the snow softened and it was soon a wade to get down to the bealach. For the final third I was engulfed in a second snow shower that this time brought a stinging hail with it, blowing right into my eyes. It wasn't pleasant so as soon as the slope eased I stopped, took off the crampons, bundled on an extra layer and (for the first time ever!) put on my ski goggles. Now I was set to go, and in the face of a shower that varied between sleet, hail and thick, wet flakes of snow, I felt entirely protected and comfortable in my gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5486695495"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5258/5486695495_02e443246d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made my way up onto Carn Dubh and as I did so, again the clouds passed overhead and I was in the sunshine once more. I could now see a large herd of deer on the skyline but despite my best efforts they got wind of me and scampered off to the west. The views across to Glenshee and back to Cairn an t-Sagairt Mor were excellent and it wasn't long before I was on the summit looking across to the day's final hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5487322594"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5059/5487322594_87b1ea2839_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now made my way around a broad coire rim before picking up a good vehicle track that dropped me down to the bealach where a track comes across from Glenshee to Loch Callater. Views initially were good, with the Glas Tulaichean hills picked out against an atmospheric sky, but as I reached the crossroads, another shower came in, this one thicker and darker than any of the previous ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a brief view of the way ahead, a curving track that climbed the broad southeastern shoulder of the hill, but after this it was head down and climb up through a misty world until I was on the rocky summit. There are a number of cairns up there but with the help of my GPS I picked out the indistinctive pile of rocks which marks the true summit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood for some time, facing into an oncoming blizzard that soon had me plastered in white snow (again, my goggles did a great job and I stayed nicely cosy in my winter jacket). After all, this was my second and final objective for the day. It would be a shame not to get a view. Luckily, just as I was about to give up I glimpsed a pale sky and moments later the blizzard had eased to drifting flakes as the wind dropped and I was out of the storm. I now had a great view down the length of the ridge which sits between Glenshee and Glen Callater. It was an ethereal grey-white with the fresh snow cover and tendrils of clouds still clung to its edges. I could also see the distinct track which runs down its length and it was this that I followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/5486764379"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5174/5486764379_8ab8a3214d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a delightful time. The track was good and easy to follow. Hush had descended on the land with the setting sun, and there was a strange quality to the clear post-storm air which is not really picked up in the photos. As the ridge continued I got views back down towards Loch Callater and then northwards to the Cairngorms with Morrone and the lights of Braemar in the foreground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I reached the end of the long march of hills and here the track turns and drops rapidly into Glen Callater. With the light fading I had my headtorch but didn't need it as the clear skies ensured there was adequate illumination. As I dropped to the glen I saw a couple of guys with big bags heading towards the loch. I rejoined the main track for the final short walk back to the car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was back at the car just as it got fully dark at a few minutes past 6. It had been a long, but incredibly rewarding day. I had successfully ticked off both my objectives, enjoyed some interesting weather and had some exceptional views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive back to Aberdeen the skies got clearer and clearer until the stars were piercingly bright, even through my windscreen. At a suitable parking spot I parked up to get a couple of shots. Unfortunately they weren't quite in focus but do show what results should be possible if I dedicate a bit more time to getting shots this far away from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sleepy bunch of Stockets emerged off the coach, bleary eyed, blinking in the March sunshine at the car park in Glen Esk. Eventually two groups formed, one heading for Loch Lee and an exploration of the hills south of the glen, whilst the larger group took the path north and west into Glen Mark. The good track means this approach to Mount Keen is easier and shorter than the approach from the north and though I had heard some complaints about the scenery, the dark crags of Gilfumman and the snow-capped hills at the head of the Glen drew the eyes onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Queenâ€™s Well was reached after an easy hour of walking. With the sun beating down we paused briefly to examine this Victorian curiosity before starting the climb up besides the Ladder burn. There was one particularly difficult river crossing with the snow melt creating a high, fast flowing stream. Most used sticks to negotiate the rocks whilst those with winter boots on waded across at the shallowest point. A couple who had ridden on bikes up Glen Mark appeared to have been defeated by this burn but we later saw them following us up the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4449982643"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2714/4449982643_1f9fb982a1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we climbed the track the views behind opened up and above the corniced lip of the narrow glen's headwall was the very top of Mt Keen, looking deceptively close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450775554"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4048/4450775554_48ae7d683e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good track became snow covered as we climbed but it was sufficiently soft to not require crampons or other aid and we wended our way up to the halfway point up the zig zags. Here we paused for a morning brew, admiring the view back down the burn and watching various persons make their way up (or in some cases down) to Mt Keen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450011775"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2780/4450011775_b2253fd820_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450797836"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2754/4450797836_97c8e58b8d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the break we continued up quickly reaching the undulating plateau which rises as a series of crests to Mt Keen. It doesn't look too far away but as you start walking you realise it is a long slog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally I believe you follow the Mounth road until a branch off to the right takes you to the summit, however all tracks were buried beneath snow and it seemed to make more sense jsut to head straight for the summit. This did involve some floudnering in deep snow, particularly along patches of heather where there seemed to be deep, snow filled trenches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450045839"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2764/4450045839_2fd2b1ebec_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually though the going much steeper and we were on the final snow covered slopes up to the summit. The parallel lines of tracks showed we were finally back on the proper route. As we crested the summit and clambered up to the summit it became clear that the mountain had been sheltering us from a considerable wind. It was good to be back at the top of my first Munro. &lt;a href="/blog/2007/11/glen-tanar-and-mount-keen/"&gt;I had climbed Mt Keen from the north on a pleasant November day in 2007&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today featured more cloud, particularly over the high Cairngorms, but the lighting was dramatic and to the west Lochnagars cliffs were seen. After a couple of moments at the trig point it became clear that it would be prudent to drop down slightly and find some shelter. Luckily Keen's bouldery summit offered a reasonably sheltered stop so we paused here for lunch whilst the rest of the group made its way up to the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450831130"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4017/4450831130_2d3e6d3130_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch we left the other folk who were simply heading back down Mt Keen via their upward tracks. We dropped rapidly down steep slopes to the bealach with Braid Cairn. The sunshine started to be broken up by intermittent showers which passed over us and all down Deeside and over the Angus hills to our south. Morven in particularly kept disappearing into angry clouds, only to emerge back in to the sunshine a few moments later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/4450863082"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2726/4450863082_7cf06aa25e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made our way slowly up the slopes of Braid Cairn, a shallow and featureless hillside that eventually turned into a featureless plateau. We turned to the north and soon came to the summit cairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4450480367/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Steady progress" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2794/4450480367_9f71aba2d7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here we had views back onto Mt Keen and onwards towards Mt Battock and the nobble of Clachnaben. The land before us was a jumble of rolling, domed hills, covered in patchy snow and it wasn't exactly clear where our next summit was. A bit of mapreading and we picked out the horseshoe that is made up of Naked Hill closest to us and the Hill of Gairney beyond. We dropped down the steeper slopes of Braid Cairn which seemed well packed with snow until we were able to head across the bealach and up onto Naked Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4450772359/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Big skies over the Angus hills" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4057/4450772359_c94441d374_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451573604/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stockets" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2713/4451573604_ab314be079_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the summit cairn we picked up the fence that is shown on the OS map and followed this around to the summit of the Hill of Gairney. As we passed the cairn and turned south a shower we had seen tracking along the hills north of the Dee gave us a sudden glimpse of a rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4450879541/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over the Deeside Hills" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2708/4450879541_e2771cc757_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451667326/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descending the Hill of Gairney" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4065/4451667326_607f94d5a3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now headed down hill to try and find the landrover track that would lead us back to Glen Esk. As we lost some height we found the outline of the track and followed this as it twisted around the contours of this bumpy wilderness. At the burn of Adekimore we paused for a bite to eat and a cup of tea, enjoying the late afternoon sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451708046/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Burn of Adekimore" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4062/4451708046_d15d5031f7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the burn we climbed up and over the Hill of Saughs  and then clambered across another snow-choked burn to cross the Hill of Kirny. After this the track began to lose more substantial height and we finally dropped below the snowline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451750822/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Afternoon sunlight over the Angus hills" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4066/4451750822_60700fd81f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4450993443/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Almost out of the snow" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4450993443_3dd6fb997c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walk out continued to follow the track, running alongside the Burn of Branny, which gave views back up to Mount Keen and Broad Cairn but also east along Glen Esk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451776780/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Final view of Braid Cairn and Mount Keen" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2687/4451776780_94d07c03c9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451827144/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heading down to Glen Esk" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2799/4451827144_826d33b03f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally as we approached Auchronie farm we had a view over Loch Lee, it's surface reflecting the low sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/4451835152/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Lee" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4451835152_d438e0179d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally we passed through the more tame farmland, went through the farmyard and came out onto the road just a short walk east of the car park where the bus was waiting for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was excitement, adventure and bacon rolls even before we hit the hill on our trip to Glen Esk for the November 2008 walk. The coach turned up a few minutes late but our troop of 19 souls who braved an inclement, dark, cold Aberdeen morning were soon being whisked down the A90 at a good pace. The rain died away, the sun rose over a steel-grey sea and our souls lifted. Unfortunately, so did the bus’ engine temperature which caused us to dive into a lay-by shortly after we had sped past the Fettercairn turn off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few anxious minutes later, having turned to head back north, we stopped again, this time straddling the hard shoulder and inside lane as the engine yet again refused to go on. The driver topped up the radiator and we crawled a little further on to the services at Strathcathrow, not before we had narrowly avoided wiping out a car as the driver yet again missed the turn and tried to head down the joining slip road!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of discussion and technical analysis outside at the services we decided to head inside where a new plan for the day was formulated over cups of coffee and bacon rolls. We had a half hour wait for a coach to come from Forfar, during which time we decided to do a shorter loop walk up over Mount Battoch and then around a few of the smaller hills in the area. It was seen as a bit risky to send our driver off around to the Clachnaben car park even if the new bus did prove to be reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new, much smaller, yet functioning bus arrived and we piled on for the last twenty minutes or so into Glen Esk. We were deposited into the cold clear sunshine close to Millden Lodge and the bridge over the Burn of Turret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3130827138"&gt;&lt;img alt="Out into the wilds" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3222/3130827138_880e17b499_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to our hot breakfast the Stockets were soon off at a good pace heading along a clear track north towards Blackcraigs. From these farm buildings it was then a gentle climb up the landrover highway onto the broad back of Mt Een (529m). As we climbed the views back into a sleepy Glen Esk opened up, and to our west the peaks above Glen Tanar appeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3130009003"&gt;&lt;img alt="Through the gate" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3113/3130009003_317381d041_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a pause for coffee we continued. From Een the track continued over the undulating slopes of Bennygray (558m) and then up towards Wester Cairn. The top of Mt Battock which had been visible for most of the walk was now close by. We followed the track up onto Wester Cairn through boggy ground whilst the following group took a more direct route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3130014597"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mt Battock" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3119/3130014597_940d68ca45_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here it was only a kilometer or so to the summit of Mt Battock where a stuff breezed forced only the brave to linger. After taking in the views of the Mounth (lochnagar and Mt Keen bathed in winter sunlight) as well as Clachnaben we sought shelter for lunch. Most people had to descend from the summit but in the sunshine behind the large cairn it was delightful and sandwiches were consumed whilst the view down Glen Esk was admired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3130033149"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben from Mt Battock" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3245/3130033149_fe117b4071_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return journey took us along the other half of the horsehoe leading down from Mt Battock. After a short section of cross-country we again picked up a well made track and headed down across the Hill of Saughs and the Hill of Turret. Somewhere on this section we came across our only sign of other walkers on the hills - the words Cairngorm Club had been scratched into the gravel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/3130880050"&gt;&lt;img alt="The final mile" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3267/3130880050_6f7b365e4d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 hours after setting out and with the sun sinking behind the hills south of the Esk we came down into the farmland around Millden Lodge and were reunited with the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stopped off for a warming pint or three in the Edzell hotel which was cosy and warm. Then it was back on the bus for a dark drive back to Aberdeen and the end of a satisfying day.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>East Glenshee 6</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/06/east-glenshee-6/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-29T09:54:23+01:00</published><updated>2008-06-29T09:54:23+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-06-29:/blog/2008/06/east-glenshee-6/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After heading to the West Coast and returning without a single additional Munro to my name last week (see this post on the spectacular Kinlochewe to Poolewe walk) I was ready to get out of Aberdeen and get up some hills a bit closer to home.

Inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.stevenfallon.co.uk/glensheeroute.html"&gt;Steven Fallon's suggested route&lt;/a&gt; I chose the mountains east of Glenshee as my destination, the idea being to bag six of them before heading back.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Due to the strange bus services going on at this time of year I was able to take the 503 from Aberdeen and get dropped off at the head of the A93 pass just south of the ski centre at Glenshee. This was great as it already gained me a significant altitude and also cut off the traditional long walk in. After a quick pause to don waterproofs against the Scotch Mist that was being blown through by strong winds I headed up the track to the summit of Meall Odhar. It's a strange world around there, particularly in the mist. Eerie items of ski equipment, rusty and forlorn, suddenly appear out of the mist, and the wind set up an unearthly wailing in the wires of the lifts. To my south it certainly looked brighter but closer at hand, my first target of the day, Creag Leacach, was hidden beneath cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2619572626"&gt;&lt;img alt="Low cloud hiding Creag Leacach" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3153/2619572626_fedd92728c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit of Meall Odhar I descended slightly, and then before the main pull up to Glas Maol began, headed southeast, picking up a narrow but well defined path that contoured around the base of Glas Maol, bringing me up to a Cairn above Bathach Beag. Here the sun came out and the clouds lifted so I stopped to remove all the waterproof gear. From the direction of Glas Maol a large party of hillwalkers came and after cheerful hello's I set off along the ridge to my first Munro of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2618769701"&gt;&lt;img alt="The ridge to Creag Leacach" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3014/2618769701_57895fb75c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creag Leacch looks an impressive hill and the ridge path took me up across a couple of boulder-strewn bumps before reaching the summit (1 hr 15). I paused for a bite of lunch and a mug of tea before heading back the way I'd ascended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of the final pull to the summit I re-passed the hillwalking group who were heading south, and now continued on my way to Glas Maol. Initially I followed a line of fence posts from the cairn I had stopped at earlier but once up the slope had to leave them and strike eastwards to find the cairn and trig point (2 hrs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2619675312"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Glas Maol" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3199/2619675312_018f970774_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clouds had rolled back in at this point and it was gloomy and windy. After a moment to celebrate my 10th Munro I headed off, descending from Glas Maol and then picking up a broad track which wound its way around the head of various Corries to reach the slopes of Cairn of Claise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2619716392"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Cairn of Claise" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3085/2619716392_54aac832a6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a long walk up but had some nice views, particularly to the south and eventually I reached the summit cairn, straddling another dry-stone wall (2hrs 40). After another quick bite to eat and some tea I headed off east with the view now opening up magnificently towards Lochnagar. Before me was Tolmount and Tom Bhuidhe and it was to the latter of these that I headed first. The bottom of the descent offered some awkward boggy ground but it didn't take long to pick up a firmer path which led me to the summit (3hrs 20). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2618902985"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn on Tom Buidhe" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3037/2618902985_3cd88cfb50_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pausing to take in the view I retraced my steps down the hill and then crossed over to the Tolmount. Again I picked up a course of iron fence posts which brought me to the flat summit (3 hrs 40). From here there were excellent views down to Loch Callater. In the distance veils of rain were covering the major bulk of the Cairngorms. Although it rained briefly at this point it was not enough to force any waterproofs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2619783582"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Callater from Tolmount" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2619783582_ebc81a1f82_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now picked my way across pathless, undulating terrain, westwards towards my final Munro of the day, Carn an Tuirc. I passed some lingering snow and chased hares across the mountains, all of the time walking into a strong and unpleasant headwind. Then, with the view back to Glenshee finally appearing, I  found a track that came down off Cairn of Claise. This led me up to the rocky expanse of the summit (4hrs 40) of Carn an Tuirc where a shelter offered me respite from the wind and the opportunity for a last mug of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2618984787"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn on Carn an Tuirc" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3160/2618984787_ac9f03f6c4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now crossed the summit plateau of Carn an Tuirc before finding a way down to the landrover track that comes up from Loch Callater. A steep descent, occasionally coming across sheep, brought me to the shores of the Loch where a number of people were enjoying the evening sunshine and having a fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2619052007"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Callater" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2619052007_fdb9828685_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down on the small beach by the lodge and rested the feet for a few minutes. Then it was off down the track heading north through Glen Callater. The sun got stronger as I hit the A93 and by the time I arrived in Braemar it was a beautiful evening. The whole walk had taken exactly 7 hours and now I had time in Braemar to enjoy a pint in the Fife Arms and have a celebratory fish supper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus back meandeared its way along Royal Deeside and I eventually returned to Aberdeen around 14 hours after leaving. For six Munros by public transport I don't think it was an unreasonable time. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>The Royal Cairns of Balmoral</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/06/the-royal-cairns-of-balmoral/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-08T10:13:18+01:00</published><updated>2008-06-08T10:13:18+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-06-08:/blog/2008/06/the-royal-cairns-of-balmoral/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a more reliable “dual alarm” system I finally managed to join fellow Stocket Dave on a non-group walk today.

Taking the 7:45am 201 we headed west as far as Crathie, the starting point for a very pleasant walk around the Balmoral estate under strong June sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren’t sure whether there was a Royal presence this weekend, but after a close encounter with a Police Land Rover near Easter Balmoral we didn’t see any other security for the rest of the day. Our walk was to take in the Royal Cairns, of which there are 9 dotted around the woods and hills of the estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2564493735"&gt;&lt;img alt="Princess Beatrice's Cairn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3004/2564493735_7694d2cf12.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was an easy find, located up a short stretch of pleasant woodland track with a fine view back down to the estate buildings at Easter Balmoral. This one proved a difficult climb so after a few attempts we moved further along the track which wound steeply up the hill to Prince Albert’s cairn on the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2564522493"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn No. 2" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3093/2564522493_170b49b856.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As would be expected this was a grand affair, a replica pyramid with a fine view of the surrounding countryside, particularly the Dee valley and the Ben Avon and Beinn a Bhuird plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then headed back to the main track, crossed it onto the other side of the valley where a short diversion took us to the third cairn. This one was set back some way from the track so we left bags and had a swift walk through the woodland. This one was climbable and offered excellent views up to Lochnagar from the summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2564548457"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from top of Purchase Cairn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3092/2564548457_0bf904f622.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one stood high above the track which afforded a fun scramble up and then another climb to reach the top of the cairn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2565383904"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing Purchase Cairn" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3081/2565383904_d6ed60fc78.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next cairn brought us back out the woodland. Purchase Cairn had been built to mark the purchase of the Balmoral estate and had a great view over the Dee Valley looking back east.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth cairn of the day had a superb view down to Balmoral where a group of newly arrived tourists were heading down the driveway into the main house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2565415554"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tip of the No. 6 and Balmoral" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3010/2565415554_6a84c3e732.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh cairn was again set away from the track but was easy enough to find using the map. It again had a fine prospect over the Dee valley and the distant mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then followed the track as it wound through the woodland, occasionally affording grand views out to Lochnagar and the rest of the Mounth. At one of these we paused to sit in the sunshine and enjoy a spot of lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2565433294"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3072/2565433294_c8ee678ef9.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seventh cairn was almost on the track but the eighth proved the most difficult of all. Located high on a craggy hill, hidden by dense foliage we had some trouble making our way around the base of the cliffs, and then up through a steep breach in the hill’s defences. Eventually, pushing our way through small pine tress, we spied the very tip of the cairn above the treetops. This was the tallest cairn of the day and I very nearly made it to the top before the handholds ran out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2564619101"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn No. 8" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3146/2564619101_cb927d0558.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now had an interesting time getting away from the cairn. Initially we followed a southwest course but a deer fence across our path diverted us to a more north-westerly heading. This luckily brought us down to a track, albeit one on the far side of the hill from our intended destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2565599176"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge over the Dee" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3102/2565599176_105d607125.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was now simply a matter of walking on the hard track alongside the Dee until we reached a suitable crossing point. Along the way we paused for a sit down on a small dam and spotted various deer in the woods. Eventually we reached a suspension bridge across the Dee which was crossed, only to find the far gate locked. Not wanting to walk a further mile upstream we clambered over the gate and then had a refreshing drink from the river whilst we waited fifteen or so minutes for the afternoon bus to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="201"></category></entry><entry><title>Lochnagar and Glas-Allt-Shiel</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/05/lochnagar-and-glas-allt-shiel/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-06T23:18:54+01:00</published><updated>2008-05-06T23:18:54+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-05-06:/blog/2008/05/lochnagar-and-glas-allt-shiel/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the third time in four weeks Lochnagar featured on my trek through the hills of Scotland.

We felt heartned by this s we came over the first rise and saw the dramatic cliffs rising in front of us, cradling the dark waters of the lochan, spray whipping across it in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2463924823"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan of Lochnagar" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3268/2463924823_bfd46a05e5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here we decided the head on up the Ladder although at times it was difficult to stand against the wind. The cloud was constantly rising and falling, occasionally obscuring the cliff tops. The ascent of the  Ladder was much easier with a clear path winding up the bouldered slopes and we soon stood on top, heading towards the first of the series of cairns which line the summit. Without any shelter we know felt the full force of the wind and knew it wasn't going to be much fun heading across to the summit, despite the walk only being a couple of kilometres. Instead we wound around the edge of the cliffs until we struck the path down towards Glas-Allt-Shiel just below Cac Carn Mor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2464785234"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mountain Stream" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3252/2464785234_37809a9446_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we now followed this path across a shallow slope of age-old slushy snow the plateau behind us was rapidly veiled by cloud that only got thicker as we left the summit area behind. Instead we walking back into the sunshine as we headed towards Loch Muick, following the strong, snowmelt strengthened flow of the Glas Allt. Descending rapidly at first beside a steep gully it gradually flattened out until the track crossed the stream on a narrow wooden bridge. Now the far wall of Glen Muick could be seen and the stream, still flowing forcefully came to the edge of the escarpment, tumbling over the brink in a forceful fall of white, angry water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2464714264"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bottom of the Fall" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3145/2464714264_a45ae4fb1f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The path wound its way steeply down besides the fall and gave us great views both of the water and of the final descent to Loch Muick, the sparkling waters of which could now be seen below us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming out at Glas-Allt-Shiel we now only had the gentle walk back along the shores of the Loch. Behind us the clouds thickened and we saw that we had escaped just in time. Now the rain was bothering the far end of the Loch and would soon be sweeping its way across the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Three Mounth Munros</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/04/three-mounth-munros/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-20T13:58:37+01:00</published><updated>2008-04-20T13:58:37+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-04-20:/blog/2008/04/three-mounth-munros/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 20 miles&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was only going to be a moderately ambitious day, with one or possibly two Munros climbed from Braemar. However in the end I did an epic traverse of the Mounth, adding Lochnagar to my journey and exiting several miles from Braemar at Crathie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catching the 07:45 Stagecoach from Aberdeen I was heading down the A93 towards the Glenshee Ski Centre a little before 10 am this morning. Retracing my steps from the day up Carn An Tuirc last month I left the A93 and headed down the beautiful, wild Glen Callater, stopping about an hour into the walk by the shores of Loch Callater. The weather was so far on my side, with sunny spells between clouds which were blowing gently through on an easterly breeze. It wasn't exactly warm but I certainly didn't need the extra layers that were required last week on the climb of Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2427013573"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of the Glen" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2155/2427013573_487db3e5c8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a stop to admire the sparkling waters of Loch Callater I started my climb, leaving the main track just before the fence around Lochcallater Lodge and following the well-made stalkers path up the side of Creag an Loch. At a burn the track turned left and gave a spectacular walk along the side of the hill above the Loch. I could now see all the way up to the head of the Glen and the dramatic snow-capped mountains surrounding it. I stopped for tea on a rock with the whole of Loch Callater spread out below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I rounded the corner to head north-east I started to meet the first snow of the day. In the snow it had melted quite significantly so was grippy but slushy. The track now meandered its way across a patch of boggy land between Creag an Loch and my first target of the day, Carn an t-Sagairt Mor, which stood much higher on my right. Eventually the track was lost beneath the snow but a set of footprints headed towards the summit and it was these which I followed as they found the surer ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb was long, heading up through snowfields of various consistency but eventually the summit cairn appeared on the horizon and I was up. The view was incredible with the mountains of the Mounth stretching out all around me, and beyond them the Cairngorm Massif including Macdui, the Cairnwell and Ben Avon. I paused here for lunch whilst I considered my options. The easiest choice would be to retrace my steps to Braemar, but with so much climbing done already it seemed sensible to make the most of the height gain and stay on the plateau. As I ate lunch a dark cloud which was troubling the summit of Lochnagar dispersed and I could clearly see a route across there giving the the option of a complete traverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2427666400"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn an t-Sagairt Mor" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2089/2427666400_855e3a8bbd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch I headed off the summit of Carn an t-Sagairt Mor, a steep descent through snow, and headed east. This took me first to the top Carn an t-Sagairt Beag (1044m) from which I could see the hard rock of the Stuic buttress, and the rounded peak of Carn a Choire Bhoidheach which was my next target of the day. At 1110m this was my second Munro of the day and marked the point where I had to decide my route home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the windswept plateau, with a clear route to the summit of Lochnagar I decided to make the most of the good weather and headed that way. Again I was following a confident set of footprints that took my back towards the Stuic, then across the gentle dip in the plateau to the slopes below Cac Carn Mor. From here I ascended, veering slightly to the north and west so that after a few minutes of steep climbing I came out with only a short stretch of the plateau between me and the summit of Cac Carn Beag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2426872427"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trig Point, Cac Carn Beag" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2047/2426872427_6ee5099617_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it was a slippery climb along a well worn track to the summit but it was worth it with stunning views all around, including the route I had taken across the plateau. There were dizzying drops all around and I was able to refer to the viewfinder to identify the peaks around me unlike the previous week when all had been hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2427722226"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar Ridge" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3278/2427722226_0b80655aae_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the summit I know retraced the route we had taken the previous week, this time taking my time to look over the cliffs and down to the frozen lochan below. A solitary snowman kept a watchful eye over the last few people to leave the summit. After a last view of the dark cliffs and corries I descended the ladder which was much more tricky without the benefit of near blindness. From the col it was then a simple matter of descending to the track and heading north to Crathie. The difference was that I got some stunning views of Lochnagar as I walked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a slightly complicated bus route home, a couple of pints in Ballater, and a fish and chip supper I put my weary legs to bed, reflecting on an epic day in the snowy mountains. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="munro"></category></entry><entry><title>Lochnagar</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/04/2008-04-13-lochnagar/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-13T12:59:27+01:00</published><updated>2008-04-13T12:59:27+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-04-13:/blog/2008/04/2008-04-13-lochnagar/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tags: munro

&lt;p&gt;Given that April is now underway, the daffodils are blooming everywhere and the days are longer and lighter you'd perhaps think that deep snow and biting winds would not be expected on the summit of a Scottish mountain no more than an hour and a half's drive from Aberdeen. Well you'd be wrong as we discovered today on the climb to Lochnagar, a 3790ft (1155m) Munro located to the south of Ballater and very close to the Royal Castle of Balmoral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2408953966"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Muick" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2408953966_4a6d59aed4_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were dropped by the coach at the Spittal of Glenmuick car park, the traditional starting point for ascending the Royal Mountain. The skies were solemn with dark brooding clouds drifting across the mountain tops and obscuring our view of Lochnagar as we crossed the Glen to begin the climb. Passing through a short section of forest, dappled by early morning sunshine, we hit the first patches of snow as we started to head up the track. The going was easy at this stage and we quickly overtook a group of Duke of Edinburgh people who were struggling along beside the stream. As we climbed, the snow became thicker underfoot and we lost sight of the sun. At a fork in the track we paused for a spot of tea and divided the group, nine souls heading left to the summit of Lochnagar itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on, until we descended to almost the same point later in the afternoon, we saw very little besides the mist, the snow and the occasional tantalising glimpse of a cliff edge or jutting rock. As we climbed up through thick snow the visibility dropped to something around 10-20 metres. It was essential that we stuck together as a group as there was nothing in the way of visual references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2409202449"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent of the ladder" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2331/2409202449_a3c2dc4fb0_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We struggled up to the col below Meikle Pap where we met a couple of climbers who were heading for the cliffs of Lochnagar. At this point we were a little above the famous corrie containing the loch of Lochnagar but nothing of this could be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not discouraged we began the steep ascent of the Ladder which takes you from corrie level up to the summit plateau. Here the snow had drifted making footing unsure. Steve, our leader, soldiered forward with his ice axe, testing the depth and picking a suitable route upwards. The snow was deep and gave good footholds so it wasn't too technical a climb but at this point a fierce wind had sprung up sending stinging spindrift into us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now had to pick our way around the edge of the cliffs with their deadly cornices of snow to the summit of the mountain, Cac Carn Beag. This was easier said than done and only with the aid of compass and GPS did we eventually come across the secondary top of Cac Carn Mor. After a brief stop for lunch we carried on, again seeing the occasional cliff edge to our right. It seemed even more difficult to find the true summit even though we were literally yards from it. Eventually a bit of luck brought us to it and out of the white loomed the peak, its trig point, and laughingly, a view point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent only a few moments there taking our pictures and celebrating success. Even a hip flask of whisky was produced. Then we were off again, the idea being to follow our tracks back down off the mountain. Again though the weather had different ideas and after only a five minutes or so we had lost them, the tracks covered by drifting snow and wind. Instead we chose a heading and followed a route down some way away from the cliff edge, passing below Cac Carn Mor and meeting a brave, solitary walker heading for the summit. We eventually met our tracks coming up the Ladder which provided an interesting descent involving a few slides and unsure footing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we descended the mist thinned slightly and to our left we saw the Lochan of Lochnagar, a frozen patch of dark barely visible through the snow. The visibility got better as we passed below Meikle Pap and made our way down the slope to the fork in the track where the group had split earlier in the day. We now got a stunning view across the Mounth, splendid beneath the snow and even had a bit of sunshine to brighten up our final stop for tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53725815@N00/2410057640"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://static.flickr.com/2058/2410057640_c879ae72e9_z_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it was simply a matter of wading through the snow along the landrover track to Balmoral. To our left the mass of Lochnagar rose into the clouds whilst before us the Cairngorms, including Ben Avon could be seen. The walk was largely uneventful except for an encounter with a "highland safari" and after about two hours we were walking through the woods around Crathie, passing the entrance to Balmoral Castle and scrambling aboard ur coach, weary but with a huge sense of achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief stop for a pint in Ballater gave us a chance to compare notes and swap stories and thanks were given to Steve who safely kept us away from the cliffs and gave me my third Munro.&lt;/p&gt;

We had a somewhat bumpy ride out south and west of Aberdeen to the remote Glen Esk where after a cry of "stop!" from most of the bus we were dropped off in the tiny hamlet of Tarfside at the southern end of The Fungle Road.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an old drover's road across the hills of the Mounth, initially used for moving cattle and more recently for whisky smuggling, and we were to walk the length of it to its end in Aboyne on Deeside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the walk took us away from Tarfside and across some exposed moorland, dotted with grazing sheep and the occassional farmhouse. In front of us the hills of the Mounth, including Gannoch opened up, and behind us we could see that the higher hills over towards Glen Clova were snow-covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2337867983/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Stocket Scene" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2029/2337867983_e6ce4ddd2f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a slight navigational error due to a relocated forest end and a newly built house we started to climb up the slopes heading to a pass between Tampie and Mudlee Bracks. Here we met the Firmounth, another right of way which comes over the hills from Glen Tanar. The signpost, a sign of civilisation on a barren hillside, was a good place to stop for pictures and a panoramic view over Glen Esk, Glen Clova and towards the hills above Glen Tanar (though Mt Keen was lost in the clouds). At this stage of the day, though very windy in the open, the sun was shining, and our tea stop was particularly pleasant as we sat by the track with the hillside to shelter us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then pushed on, walking through the pass and entering the Cairngorm National Park. A narrow path, freshly sand-covered, now dropped down steeply with a burn flowing in a narrow defile below us. We had an entertaining time jumping or fording the small streams that came off the hillside but eventually made it down to our lunch stop at Birse Castle, a remote farming community in a small valley between the two lines of hills we were crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2338683500/"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Road Goes Ever On" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2068/2338683500_3c03482bd3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch in the sunshine we now climbed out of this second valley, traversing a somewhat rickety bridge and climbing up on a wide landrover track. As we pushed on across the hilltop a thick veil of rain slowly covered the valley to our east and seconds later the first drops were hitting us, prompting hoods up against the unpleasant conditions. Shelter was sought at a hunter's bothy and no sooner had water proof trousers been donned did the sun reappear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the track a short way we came to the edge of the Forest of Birse where the landrover track was left behind and we descended quickly through an old pine wood, the ground springy underfoot and encouraging us to a good pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a final tea stop we quickly walked the final three or so kilometres down into Aboyne, leaping another stream, dropping down past a viewing point and eventually crossing the Dee before seeking warmth and a well-earned pint or two at the Boat Inn.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Glen Callater and Carn An Tuirc</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/03/glen-callater-and-carn-an-tuirc/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-01T22:32:12+00:00</published><updated>2008-03-01T22:32:12+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-03-01:/blog/2008/03/glen-callater-and-carn-an-tuirc/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the forecast promising everything from clear skies right through to blizzards and howling winds I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I set out for Braemar this morning.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2302586625/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Clunie" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2344/2302586625_f7317b073a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Glen Clunie was somewhat lost in the murky conditions I only had to head a mile or so down it before turning into Glen Callater at the bridge near Auchallater. Things immediately looked up with the light considerably brighter and the snow left behind to trouble Braemar. Immedaitely away from the main road the scenery became wilder with the Callater burn jumping down over rocks and stones, and above it the grey, bare shoulders of the hills rising up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track wound its way up Glen Callater with the hills rising into dramatic mountains that crowded round the head of the Glen. Over to the right was the domed shape of Carn An Tuirc with a healthy covering of snow on its crown. I stopped for a mug of tea and a bite to eat on the shore of Loch Callater, a thin loch between the encroaching hills, the surface of which was being rippled by the wind which had steadily been picking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2303429306/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Top of Glen Callater" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2063/2303429306_0aa4937560_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After donning another layer I headed up away from the Loch, climbing steeply up onto the shoulders of Carn An Tuirc. After the first climb the land flattened slightly and I crossed a patch of moorland between the heights where the first snow was encountered. After this the climb began again, heading up to a cairn where the track disappeared. I now headed off across the broad ridge of Carn An Tuirc, still climbing and heading for what I thought was the summit ridge. There was still plenty of snow so the way was good but the wind was ferocious, blowing snow across the surface. On reaching the Cairn I discovered that it was a false flat and the summit lay a few hundred meters beyond, slightly higher up. Evaluating the conditions I decided it was best not to push for the top, but descended down a good run of snow back to the moorland where the snow finished and I had to pick my way through a boggy area of streams and small pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2303488064/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Carn an Tuirc beyond" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2212/2303488064_c584d67d05_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now heading west with the ski center on the Cairnwell clearly visible in the sunshine. Over to my left beyond the far shoulder of Carn An Tuirc was Glas Maol. Below me the A93 snaked its way up towards Glen Shee and it was for this that I headed, descending by the side of the burn that cascaded down in a nice series of rapids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2303550710/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Late Afternoon in the Highlands" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/2303550710_e1d175689f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On gaining the road I then walked the six or so miles back up to Braemar, enjoying the late afternoon sunshine and the Glen as it opened out before me. I got back in time to get the 5pm bus back from Braemar, glad of the chance to rest my feet which were weary from walking on tarmac for so long.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Pannanich Hills</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/02/pannanich-hills/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-16T22:29:41+00:00</published><updated>2008-02-16T22:29:41+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-02-16:/blog/2008/02/pannanich-hills/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 11 Miles&lt;br&gt;

So it was that just after 8am we were heading out of town on a warm coach, bound for Deecastle, just beyond Dinnet on the south side of the River Dee.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was a cold, crisp morning, with the sun shining brightly as we headed up away from the road to the top of Slai Na Gour (486m). After a couple of slightly wrong turns we took a good track towards the top but eventually had to break from it and head directly up the heathery slopes, climbing over small rocks and the occasional trickle of water flowing amongst the moss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2270020850/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slai na Gour" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2063/2270020850_bd78161778_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approached the top the majestic peak of Lochnagar could be seen to the west, with the bulk of Morven behind us. From the summit cairn we had a great view of our route to the west, heading along a range of undulating hills that rise above Glen Tanar to the south. Mount Keen, which I climbed last November, stood proudly at the end of the valley, it's tooth-like tip silhouetted against the low sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a mug of tea, and before hypothermia set in, we headed off along the plateau, dropping down to begin the ascent up to the summit of Black Craig (529m), a broad flat topped hill that led quickly on to Craigrae Beg with the views ahead opening out all the time. This time when we came down off the hill we joined a right of way coming from Deeside and crossing over into Glen Tanar. We followed this a short distance before crossing the boggy Black Moss where occasionaly pools and streams were ready to catch a misplaced foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brought us to the climb up to the top of Knockie Branar (606m) where after getting through a deer fence we found a spot to stop for our lunch. Ahead we had an amazing view of both Lochnagar and the Cairngorms Massif with the distinctive peaks covered in snow. We could also see Morrone and its radio mast in the very far distance. Mount Keen was now directly to our south and in the foreground was the Pannanich Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2269379975/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Magnificent Panorama" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2060/2269379975_4d36ea885b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we dropped down and crossed another shallow valley with the banks of the stream still covered in snow. We joined a drover's path which came from Glen Muick heading for Mount Keen and following this brought us to the summit of Craig Vallich (609m) where the view surpassed even that of the lunch stop. We had a panoramic view of Lochnagar and Glen Muick with the Cairngorms forming a dramatic backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now turned north, heading along the broad ridge to the summit of the Pannanich Hill (601m) where, next to the summit cairn and trig point we had the last of the tea and looked back along the path we had come. All along this part of the walk we had been following a herd of deer who had now headed off down to the more remote slopes for a bit of peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2271590457/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2207/2271590457_f564bf50fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reach the pub in Ballater we now had a steep descent through boggy ground until we reached the Pannanich Forest (famous as a home of the endangered Capercaille) which led us down to the bridge over the Dee and the comforts of the Prince of Wales pub.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Glen Dye and Clachnaben</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2008/01/glen-dye-and-clachnaben/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-27T22:42:25+00:00</published><updated>2008-01-27T22:42:25+00:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2008-01-27:/blog/2008/01/glen-dye-and-clachnaben/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance: 6 miles&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went walking today with a friend from work. After a slight problem with a closed road and diversion, we got to the car park at Glen Dye by 10 this morning. Under slightly hazy skies but ridiculously mild air we crossed into Miller's Bog, walking along a good forest track. From there we turned north, following a landrover track up and around Greystane Hill which has been planted with new conifer trees in recent years. As we approached the top a young deer sprang across the road and moved up the hill, turning to watch us with unwavering eyes for a couple of minutes before turning and moving off. The track eventually peetered out in a boggy patch of land where a small burn came off the lower slopes of Mount Shade. We headed up the firmer ground along its bank before coming to a deer fence. Instead of following it west towards our target we gained some height and crossed it at a point higher up where another clear track wound its way along a line of the hills. This gave us some stunning views over Miller's Bog, southward to the Howe of the Mearns and eventually brought the Granite-plugged peak of Clachnaben into view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2223249931/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2022/2223249931_de6f0e7197_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our direction now more or less clear we headed in the direction of the main track up to the summit, wending our way through a short section of forest that would have been better avoided by sticking to the slopes of Mount Shade rather than descending into the valley. After a tortuous route through the trees and jumping across a small brook we gained the good track and made good progress up the summit, now looming above us like a smaller Devil's Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Clachnaben Path Trust and they had done a good job of making a firm track, with steps laid on the steeper sections. With the sun now shining through it proved to be a popular route as we passed several people. It was a stiff climb but we were rewarded as the views opened up around us, Bennachie to the North over Deeside and the snow covered mountains around Lochnagar to the west. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/2223273142/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2141/2223273142_de0584764b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We eventually gained the foot of the granite plugged where we paused to catch our breath and have a bit to eat. It was then just a brief scramble up the northern, shallower side of the granite to gain the very top where we could sit and admire the view. A few other people were up there as well but it didn't spoil the scene too badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way back was swift, taking us back down the track and this time straight across Miller's Bog where bridges have been put in to avoid the worst of the water. We had beautiful views back across the way we had come as the shadows started to lengthen but very soon we were back at the car after a successful excursion and one that has whetted our appetite for bigger things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I went on a superb walk through some real, rugged Scottish countryside. I caught the 7:45am bus from Aberdeen out to the small village of Dinnet, beyond Aboyne on the A93. Arriving at 9:15 I immediately set out south, crossing the Dee and then talking a narrow farm track across the small hill close to Tillycairn. This soon dropped down to the Water of Tanar which flows through &lt;a href="http://www.glentanar.co.uk/"&gt;Glen Tanar&lt;/a&gt; at a place called Millfield. The path now turned right, heading south-west along the Tanar and past Glen Tanar House and its small loch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1849071279/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent into Glen Tanar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2367/1849071279_8c6572a956_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next hour and half the track passed through the Forest of Glen Tanar, a pleasant stretch of native Caledon forest dominated by pines. I didn't meet another person on the road and it was a pleasant, peaceful walk with the sound of the river beside me and the colours of autumn all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 11am I stopped at Half Way Hut for a brief cup of tea. From here it was only another 15 minutes before I left the woods and came into the open scenery of the top end of the Glen. Here the hills quickly climbed up, reaching heights of 500-600m around me. With the heather turning it was a stunning sight. As I rounded the corner near Etnach farm I caught my first sight of the mountain - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Keen"&gt;Mount Keen&lt;/a&gt;, the most easterly Munro at 939m and my target for the day. It was an imposing sight, much taller than the hills around me, and barren looking from this distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1846975481/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Keen from Glen Tanar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2356/1846975481_d1dd6108c3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track continued to follow the Tanar, crossing it on two occasions across old arched-stone bridges before it joined the Mounth Road, an ancient drovers track coming across the hills from Ballater. Joining this I crossed the Tanar one last time on a new footbridge (constructed after the previous crossing was washed away in a flood in 2000) before immediately climbing up onto the western shoulder of Mt Keen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already behind me stunning views opened up, looking across the hills, and back down Glen Tanar. In front of me and to my left the mountain continued to climb dramatically. It was a steep but steady slope with a well marked track. Soon I was on the western shoulder from here the track left the Mounth Road and continued up to the summit. I now had fine views over to the Caingorms, and in particular Lochnagar, the closest Munro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After putting on my waterproof coat (to keep out the wind), hat and gloves I made my way up the final steep slope to the summit. Again the track was good and I only had to scramble on a couple of occassions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1847168714/"&gt;&lt;img alt="At the summit of Mt. Keen (Munro, 939m, 3081ft)" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2411/1847168714_bad6b52a0b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 3 hrs 30 mins of walking I reached the summit, clambering up to the trig point and taking in the stunning views whilst holding on against a strong westerly wind. All around the skies had cleared to reveal a stunning landscape of hills, moors and valleys. The Caingorms lie to the west of here and they could be seen rearing up beyond Lochnagar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other people at the summit who had approached from the south, and after eating lunch I asked one of them to take my summit shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1862979970/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Tanar" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2254/1862979970_ff5c0bba76_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just after 1pm I turned back and followed the route I had come to get back to Dinnet. The shadows were lengthening but the late afternoon sunlight in the Glen was stunning and it was a great walk back. I didn't have time for many stops, and made it across the tops to Dinnet with the sun sinking. I arrived back at the bus stop at 4:15pm, 7 hours after setting out that morning and only had a short wait for the bus back to Aberdeen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a great day and climbing my first Munro gave me a great feeling of achievement and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

Although slightly delayed due to two dozen or so German students trying to buy a group discount ticket, we headed westward up &lt;a href="http://www.royal-deeside.org.uk"&gt;Royal Deeside&lt;/a&gt; under beautiful, clear sunny skies and arrived in Banchory just under an hour later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes getting my bearings I headed south, crossing the River Dee and then following it west until I reached the entrance to &lt;a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/website/recreation.nsf/LUWebDocsByKey/ScotlandAberdeenshireBlackhallForestScoltyWoodlandParkScoltyCarPark"&gt;Scolty&lt;/a&gt;, a Forestry Commision area with some very well marked woodland paths. At this time the clear skies had been covered by some grey, rolling cloud, but as I started to climb up on a wide track, through marching rows of pines the sun yet again started to peek out. The colours of autumn were evident further on once I hit some of the less managed woodland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1806262868/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Forest Walk" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2224/1806262868_091b6b88c7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well made path soon turned and climbed steeply up Scolty hill, and the way became uneven and slippery with exposed rocks and roots ready to catch out a misplaced feet. Luckily the sun had come out and the views away north, west and east were spectacular, encompassing a great sweep of the Dee valley, and Banchory away behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of the hill, 396m high according to my map, I came to General Burnett's momument, a tall round tower that commanded remarkable views over the rising foothills of the Caingorms. A narrow spiral staircase took me to the top and I spent a few minutes enjoying the sight and breathing in the bright, fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1794780561/"&gt;&lt;img alt="General Burnett's Monument, Scolty Hill" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2151/1794780561_b598c2376d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the bottom I checked out some of the landmarks visible from this height, had a bite of lunch, before heading off over some of the heather-clad moorland which lead off south from the heights. Dropping off the hill I came into a shallow valley between Scolty and the next summit where a broad track took me back around the base of the hill and into the woods. I followed a different track now which took me through some beautiful beech forest, before climbing back up, following the course of a wee burn to the carpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/black_friction/1798245540/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Autumn Leaves" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2019/1798245540_f23a44127d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back to Banchory I stopped off at the river Feugh, where a narrow stonebridge, and an ugly metal footbridge, crossed high over the falls where at the right time of the year salmon can be seen jumping up the stream. Here again the autumn leaves were showing off their rich, ruddy colours and the falls were loud and swift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got back to Banchory just in time to catch the bus back to Aberdeen and reached home just as the sunset, the night falling disconcertingly early after British Summer Time had ended the morning before.&lt;/p&gt;
