&lt;h2&gt;Route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder here is my route as recorded by my Spot Messenger over the course of the Crossing. You can zoom in and scroll around to explore my actual track (in orange) and my planned route (in green).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 9, Sunday 19th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Aviemore to Wild Camp in Glen Derry&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 30km (Total: 214km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Lurcher’s Crag, Ben MacDui (Munro)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the previous evening I had not managed to successfully plug my phone into the charger. It of course died sometime in the night and so I ended up waking up with a jolt at 8:50am, almost three hours later than had been my norm on the Challenge so far! Unfortunately I’d agreed with Rich that we’d be walking by 9, so the much hoped for relaxed morning turned into rather a rush: de-packaging and sorting out food; showering and packing the sack; and charging the dead phone as much as possible. I felt rather annoyed with myself, especially as I wouldn’t get much of a chance to charge my phone between now and the East Coast. Luckily I had charged my battery pack the previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAoT5o" title="Aviemore Youth Hostel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aviemore Youth Hostel" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/8921863130_8dfd463533_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more faffing we got going by about 10am. The skies were grey with plenty of low cloud hanging over Aviemore, whilst the temperature was noticeably more pleasant than in recent days. Despite the greyness we were still quietly confident that we’d find the sun higher up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We left Aviemore by the main road, following the cycleway a short distance towards Coylumbridge before leaving the tarmac to pick up one of the many tracks that weaves its way through the wonderful Rothiemurchas forest. We ambled along, enjoying the damp woods and the still lochans. A short stretch of road walking then took us down to Loch an Eilien. We did get a few strange looks from the tourists heading down the road to the popular car park but once on the north shore they and their metal boxes were left behind and we were back in pleasant, peaceful surrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eApTpC" title="P1070454 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070454" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/8922059358_40b8ccd5db_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAoGXE" title="Lochan near Whitewell by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan near Whitewell" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/8921829100_408e759330_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Loch an Eilien we were back on woodland tracks, skirting the loch by its northern shore and then following tracks through thinning pines to the Lairig Ghru junction near Whitewell. The Allt Beahdaidh crossed by the Cairngorm Club footbridge was a torrent of turbulent water and we paused briefly by the bank to take photos. As we started the climb up we caught up with a guy plodding along under the weight of a heavy-looking canvas pack. He was up from England, supplied for 6 or so days wandering around the Cairngorms, and was already regretting wearing lined trousers as the close air amongst the pines was warm and humid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAkqhk" title="Near the Cairngorm Club Footbridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Near the Cairngorm Club Footbridge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/8921187659_2e02553c94_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wound our way up the track, through the woods with the stream tumbling below us. The cloud was obstinate and views didn’t materialise. We came into the lower reaches of the Lairig Ghru and here caught up with a Challenger from Oxfordshire. He’d had a late start from by the Cairngorm  Club bridge and was having an easy-paced stroll through the Ghru towards Mar Lodge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came into the narrow upper part of the pass and here found deep lingering stretches of snow pasted over the boulders. The surface seemed solid enough and there was plenty of indication of the passage of feet in the last few days. The slow climb up the snow in the misty ravine was very atmospheric and as we came upon the area where the Sinclair hut used to stand we decided to take a break for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAow8q" title="Snow slope in the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow slope in the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8921792662_ceb97ac7f3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few folk passed us by and one excitable chap with a jauntily angled rucksack promised that it was clear and sunny on the far side of the Ghru. We weren’t sure we believed him but moments later the mist suddenly lifted and we had a stunning view of Lurcher’s Crag above us, tendrils of cloud winding in and out of its cliffs and rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAosQ7" title="Lurcher's Crag above the Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lurcher's Crag above the Ghru" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/8921781566_33d4d83971_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartened by this change in weather I decided to follow my original plan of climbing Macdui and then dropping down to Glen Derry via the Hutchison Hut, rather than going the long way round via the Lairig Ghru. Rich was also following this route although his original day was planned to take him only as far as the Hut today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAkgkr" title="Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8558/8921157563_b6f35782cb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We backtracked down the steep snow slope and then picked up the Chalamain Gap path as it climbed out of the Ghru heading northeast towards the ski centre road. We were back in the mist now so there was no view for a while. Further on a small cairn marked a path branching off towards the lower slopes of Lurcher’s Crag. This proved to be a good path which rose quickly up amongst boulders and grit, occasionally being lost in a boulder field, but easy enough to follow on the far side. I made rapid progress and was soon ascending above thinning cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAojDd" title="Through the clouds by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Through the clouds" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5443/8921754022_ce81a00500_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Away to the west Sgor Gaoith was a prominent dark peak above the cloud whilst closer the radiating ridges of Braeriach sailed clear of the cloud like dark galleons. The full extent of the inversion was revealed as I reached the plateau and looked back over a sea of white cloud extending far to the north. It was an incredible sight. Away to the east the Northern Corries were picked out by snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAk8rc" title="Braeriach above the inversion by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Braeriach above the inversion" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3687/8921130985_a1b4563278_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAog4S" title="Above the inversion by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Above the inversion" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7292/8921741996_ac851a6cd3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAk5hg" title="Cairn Gorm and the Northern Coires by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Gorm and the Northern Coires" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3808/8921120375_cb7eae1778_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the cairn I stopped for food and water and to apply sunscreen. I lazed around in the sunshine but there was still no sign of Rich. Assuming he was taking his time and photographing the inversion further down I decided to start making my way across the plateau. There were a few snow patches that I was eyeing up and I was keen to know I could make progress and didn’t have to think about turning around at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAobwL" title="Lairig Ghru from Lurcher's Crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lairig Ghru from Lurcher's Crag" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7301/8921726736_4b7bb7092e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAjWzK" title="Cloud in the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud in the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/8921094477_1351095bea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAo3cy" title="Lurcher's Crag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lurcher's Crag" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/8921698710_fd1d6be1a0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAnZNj" title="Slopes above the Lairig Ghru by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Slopes above the Lairig Ghru" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8407/8921690634_cc357fe231_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The up and down of the plateau is deceptive and there were still plenty of feet of ascent to gain before reaching the high summit of Ben Macdui. The northern slopes were still covered in snow but there was a rapid melt going on and the surface yielded easily to footsteps. I kept a slow but steady pace up each rise, pausing at the top of each one. I occasionally caught a glimpse of Rich in the distance but he seemed content to make progress at his own slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAnXQQ" title="Lurcher's Crag above inversion by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lurcher's Crag above inversion" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/8921684052_df3707b5b2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAjGNa" title="Cairn Toul from the Plateau by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairn Toul from the Plateau" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7348/8921048101_38eb2ec8cc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of me the shapely peaks to the west of the Lairig Ghru slowly emerged from behind Breariach’s bulk. Cairn Toul and the Angel’s Peak were picked out by snow and there were impressive cornices around the rim of the Garbh Coire. The ground around the March Pool was waterlogged, the gravel acting more like a sponge, but beyond this the final rise to the summit was on snow and I made the last of the ascent, passing a group who were leaving the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAjJRH" title="Summit of Macdui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Macdui" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7351/8921055035_a78d617563_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was great to finally reach the summit of MacDui, the high point at 1,309m, of my crossing. Now I had to make a decision about whether to wait or not. It looked like Rich was still a long way off. I sent off a message saying I would be on the summit until five and then set about eating food, drinking water and enjoying the views off to the west and east, though the hazy cloud was beginning to thicken up. My feet were cold and wet from the snow and it was getting more difficult to keep them warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At five I decided to set off. I wanted to use the early evening to make some progress further into Glen Derry, ensuring I kept to my plan, and it would be good to get back below to snowline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAnHKE" title="Deeside and Mounth from Macdui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Deeside and Mounth from Macdui" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3783/8921636656_d39673a945_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAjwu8" title="South from Ben Macdui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="South from Ben Macdui" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/8921013415_77262f2753_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dropped quickly down the snowy southern slopes of Macdui, this side of the hill being much more consistently covered than back on the plateau. I traipsed down through the snow, crossed the stream below Coire Sputan Dearg which was swollen from snow melt and then followed roughly the line of the path down towards Loch Etchachan. As I lost height cloud swept in over the summit and down the coire, temporarily blanketing me in mist. I continued on and eventually the shadowy outline of Loch Etchachan reappeared out of the gloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAnuN3" title="Clag over Loch Etchachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clag over Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8535/8921593062_285ee50439_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time I was at its icy shore the sun was back out and Cairn Gorm stood clear in the gap beyond the loch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAji7r" title="Loch Etchachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8395/8920968425_55fa257806_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAnfbw" title="Loch Etchachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Etchachan" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5461/8921543906_09468aec12_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trio were setting up a Trailstar at the far end and I gave them a wave as I picked up the track down to the Hutchison Hut. With the cloud cleared there was now a beautiful evening sunlight in the hills and the descent down to the hut besides the tumbling allt was an utter delight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAiYdv" title="Path to Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Path to Glen Derry" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5444/8920904861_a4027a5ae2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAiUTB" title="The cliffs of Etchachan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The cliffs of Etchachan" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5451/8920893673_657d1b56a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAn1iu" title="Looking into Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking into Glen Derry" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8128/8921497214_392ee1310d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hutchison Hut looked very tidy following its renovation but I continued on, crossing the Glas Allt Mòr with only wet feet, and then continuing down the glen as the evening slowly advanced. Past the plantation I left the track and negotiated bog to reach the river banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAiFvk" title="Hutchinson Hut in Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hutchinson Hut in Glen Derry" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5441/8920848649_dd579a9228_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAmKYJ" title="Derry Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Derry Water" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8140/8921449030_916925a66d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAitCk" title="Walking through Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking through Glen Derry" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8128/8920808687_36f16ef88a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I followed along until I found a decent looking camping spot by an imposing Scots Pine. The water was flowing strongly, careering into the bank just below the tree’s roots. it was just on 7pm when I got the tent up and the evening was warm with barely a breath of wind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAmywf" title="Wild camp in Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camp in Glen Derry" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/8921410490_56af937814_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the camp site turned out to be quite buggy with lots of strange little flies and some giant earwigs that managed to crawl just about everywhere. The warm weather seemed to have encouraged every insect in the Cairngorms to emerge simultaneously. Despite these intrusions it was pleasant to sit with my back to the pine and eat dinner and enjoy a hot chocolate as the gloaming slowly crept down Glen Derry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAmpuj" title="Camped in Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camped in Glen Derry" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3750/8921380102_aff17148ba_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAmkXJ" title="Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Derry" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3694/8921368236_3da60e2fd2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the bugs refusing to leave, after dinner I retreated to the noseeum sanctuary of my tent and pulled out my Kindle to read a couple of chapters of &lt;em&gt;Wildwood&lt;/em&gt; before the light faded. About 10pm Rich arrived having decided to carry on beyond the Hutchison Hut. He too discovered the delights of the local insect population and as he was getting himself sorted for the night the long day caught up with me and I fell into a comfortable sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 10, Monday 20th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp in Glen Derry to Wild Camp in Glen Gairn&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 30km (Total 244km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHBP6" title="Derry Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Derry Water" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7441/8925518911_f0a64c4457_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine on the tent woke me from my slumbers before 7am after an enjoyably long and deep sleep. I woke up to find Rich had pitched just down from me. I went about my morning routine, coffee and breakfast and getting things sorted for the day ahead. Rich also got up and we had a look at his route choices for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHLuv" title="Mist in Glen Derry by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mist in Glen Derry" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5335/8925548109_2914076cfc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 9am I was ready to get going and bid Rich, who was onto his second coffee, farewell and good luck. I recrossed the bog and was soon on the pleasant track winding my way down the remainder of Glen Derry. A cloud inversion lower down the glen had dispersed but the higher tops still held on to a covering of mist. A few folk were about but it was a largely calm and pleasant morning. The good weather of the day before appeared to be holding steady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed by Derry Lodge and Bob Scotts and came down into the pleasant, familiar surrounds of Glen Lui. My autopilot was on as I followed the track I’ve walked more than a dozen times before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAKU3j" title="Glen Lui Road by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Lui Road" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3731/8925963726_f35a60fd77_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAGFwk" title="Cairngorms from Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms from Glen Lui" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/8925336283_3b76f863ca_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was back onto new ground when I took a narrow side path which ran uphill to the east besides a tributory of the Lui Water. I caught and passed a group of girls struggling their way uphill under heavy backpacks and then caught and passed a similar sized group of boys as we dropped slightly into Clais Fhearnaig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAGxaz" title="Track to Clas Fearnig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track to Clas Fearnig" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5470/8925308167_49ba7d771e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAGrCx" title="Track away from Glen Lui by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track away from Glen Lui" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5468/8925289547_2a2c89c70a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAG7T4" title="Clas Fearnig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clas Fearnig" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7412/8925226473_9c21dcec31_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first time in this curious little cutting that links Glen Lui through to Glen Quoich. It was a little breezy down by the narrow lochan but I enjoyed stopping and sitting for ten minutes to have a snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAKc9f" title="Clas Fearnig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clas Fearnig" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2818/8925826146_ca8bb99cc4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAJS81" title="Lochan in Clas Fearnig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan in Clas Fearnig" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2851/8925762158_10d336122d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down in Glen Quoich I met the instructors who were up from Perth assessing the group on their bronze DofE trip. We had a good chat about backpacking and my journey across the country. Then I was off down to the crossing of the Allt an Dubh-ghlinne. This turned out to be an interesting one with the river running swift and deep in places, overflowing the banks and an indicator of things to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAFvYB" title="Cloud clearing in Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud clearing in Glen Quoich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2825/8925109055_6eb247070b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAJkMf" title="Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Quoich" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/8925660092_9d1f33721d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I was on new ground as I followed a vehicle track along the north bank of the Quoich Water below the foothills of Beinn a’ Bhuird. The track ended at another crossing of the river and it looked like a rough path of sorts continued on the far side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAJgYy" title="Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Quoich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2807/8925647292_0ab522932b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAJd87" title="Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Quoich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2823/8925634332_f8f5d01ebc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to cross, using my poles to brace myself as I faced upstream into the current. I got across safely and picked up the muddy pack, only slightly dismayed when I saw a clear track emerge on the bank I had just left! This track (which looks recently upgraded) runs all the way down the length of the Quoich to the point at which the Slugain track crosses the river en route to Beinn a’ Bhuird. I didn’t fancy adding two more crossings of the Quoich so stuck with my muddy, undulating path on the south bank. It wasn’t great and progress was slow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAJ9hG" title="Woodland in Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Woodland in Glen Quoich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2839/8925621432_9402e6446f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAERHz" title="Beinn a' Bhuird across Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Bhuird across Glen Quoich" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3795/8924980351_e859863882_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAEHS4" title="Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Quoich" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2812/8924953931_d2f9058cdd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I came into a little glade of trees and stopped here for some lunch. The sun was shining and down in the glen it was very warm and humid. Refreshed I tackled the last stretch of largely trackless walking. Eventually the trees thinned and a faint track emerged as I came into the upper reaches of the glen. It was a relief to join the track leading up from Slugain to the Sneck and once again I was on familiar ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHW5b" title="Ben Avon beyond Glen Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Avon beyond Glen Quoich" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/8925580338_6a59e926a7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAEDwT" title="Quoich Water by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Quoich Water" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8130/8924939363_4b8f1d454a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHCRu" title="Beinn a' Bhuird by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Beinn a' Bhuird" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5336/8925522414_f21226e5d2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful walking in the sunshine and I stopped to admire the views up to the big mountains of Beinn a’ Bhuird and Ben Avon. Behind me the central Cairngorms were receding into the distant haze. I refreshed my water supply from a side stream and then ambled on up the glen. I was last here back in February when a lot of the ground was snow covered. Even without snow I still managed to miss the obvious cairn marking the turning off to Glen Gairn but realised my mistake and was soon enough on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAEqEZ" title="The path to the Sneck by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The path to the Sneck" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2874/8924896101_98c8fa733b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHu99" title="Cloud over Ben Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over Ben Avon" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/8925493104_80c325f613_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAEgwn" title="Track up from the Quoich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track up from the Quoich" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/8924865325_e065bb85a0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February this had just been a faint white line, almost indiscernible from the surrounding heather, but I enjoyed the bimble on a good track with the views opening out towards the Gairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHkwE" title="Track towards Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track towards Glen Gairn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7452/8925464134_9f5fe4c816_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAHfbE" title="Dropping into Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dropping into Glen Gairn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3693/8925446154_a5a36f5d4b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Progress was easy and I was soon in the deep cutting between Creah an Dail Bheag and Mhòr where the stream winds between grassy areas and jumbles of rock. On one of these I stopped for another food break as the rising breeze was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eADVgH" title="In Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="In Glen Gairn" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3717/8924797195_681576c36e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the other side I had a number of interesting stream crossings where the snow melt on the Ben Avon plateau had swollen minor burns. This led to burst banks and the green-blue hint that told of snow and ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAGNdC" title="Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Gairn" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5330/8925358804_78f8090973_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eADAZn" title="Ben Avon by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Avon" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3669/8924735695_54b8bcbba6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eADwNp" title="Ben Avon from Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Avon from Glen Gairn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2832/8924721603_146cbf16c2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eADusV" title="Track through Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Gairn" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8277/8924713745_ff2d7a9d5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond them though Glen Gairn was an easy walk although the weather deteriorated with a slow build up of cloud through the afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eADhvk" title="Looking across the Gairn to Carn Liath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across the Gairn to Carn Liath" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5448/8924673517_c9666e45d0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAGhYL" title="Lochan near Builg by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochan near Builg" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/8925260444_db5774a293_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near Loch Builg I turned to follow the Gairn down towards Corndavon Lodge, another new stretch of track and as the the last couple of kms passed I started to look forward to camping in the comfortable surrounds of the lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAD1Vp" title="Glen Gain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Gain" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/8924621089_1bc69ccd08_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAG6hb" title="Looking east down Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking east down Glen Gairn" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5337/8925221086_b39816545f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eACQug" title="Track through Glen Gairn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track through Glen Gairn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/8924585991_dd3cef698b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas it was not to be. Sheep had commandeered the flat, green grass surrounding the lodge so I continued on downstream a short way. There was a work party doing some planting (wading back and forth across the river to ferry tools and materials) but I figured I wouldn’t be disturbing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAFPhu" title="Corndavon Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corndavon Lodge" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/8925167280_fb550d78ac_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eAFyNo" title="Wild camping hear Corndavon Lodge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camping hear Corndavon Lodge" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7289/8925118554_31ff5c34bd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind had strengthened but I got the tent up ok, evicting several insects that had hitched a ride down from Glen Derry. I gathered water from the river and then as the first rain started retired to cook dinner, read and listen to a couple of podcasts before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 11, Tuesday 21st May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp in Glen Gairn to Wild Camp below Cock Cairn&lt;br&gt;
Distance:  35km (Total 279km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Geallaig (Graham), Pannanich Hill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the next morning there was no clear sign of an improvement in the weather. With even the lower surrounding hills shrouded in fog I slowly packed up and got on my way. The morning was quiet with dull skies and the only sound the bleating of sheep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCagLo" title="P1070593 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070593" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3722/8941840882_b4d83d9e7d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as I rounded a corner further down the glen the long rise of Geallaig Hill was suddenly seen in full, the cloud having lifted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCadCy" title="P1070594 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070594" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2815/8941830336_fa65bfddfd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC6Zbk" title="P1070595 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070595" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3702/8941199747_a8e94a0778_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCa4sU" title="P1070597 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070597" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3715/8941799500_afc81131fb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now felt better about heading up and wound round the last few farms to the military road, crossing it to gain access to Geallaig by its western flank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC6LHk" title="P1070599 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070599" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5465/8941157813_4ab2e41edc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC6EVB" title="P1070601 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070601" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3806/8941138341_6ee8a52a9e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A steady pace got me to the top of a hill that offers fine views up and down the Dee. Close at hand was Morven, catching some sunshine, whilst across the river the crags and cliffs of Lochnagar looked very fine indeed. Further off the Cairngorms were still hidden beneath clouds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC6whB" title="Lochnagar from Geallaig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar from Geallaig" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8548/8941109283_4ca48e453b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC9DCq" title="Mount Keen from Geallaig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Keen from Geallaig" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7362/8941719316_6f08b92e74_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC9AQj" title="P1070606 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="P1070606" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5342/8941709914_2c50b96d35_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a second breakfast in the wind shelter on Geallaig before turning east to traverse the two tops on this side of the hill. The going was easy enough on a landrover track with occasional stretches of short heather. From the cairn on the final summit I looked down into the bottom of Glen Gairn which is suddenly civilised with roads, farms and sunshine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut down towards the woods above Culsh and followed a faint track down to the farm road. I walked through the deserted farmyard and then cut down through fields finally having to gingerly clamber over a barbed-wire fence to reach the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short way down I came to my first east coast marker, a road sign telling me I was just 43 miles from Aberdeen! I picked up the Ballater path network, following the road briefly before dropping down to walk into the village by the delightful riverside path. By now it seemed that the sun was out to stay and the day had warmed up dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Ballater I stopped at The Bothy for a delicious lunch of soup and sandwich followed by a huge fruit scone with a mug of coffee and a pot of tea. They kindly allowed me to charge up my phone and next door in the Braemar Mountain Sports shop I was able to buy a pair of Teko socks to replace my ragged socks. Feeling thoroughly satisfied I popped down the road to the Co-op to restock, encountering the worst selection of dry meals so far, and then sat on the green in the sunshine to sort out food, socks and place calls to Challenge Control and home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC5EFV" title="Ballater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ballater" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7413/8940942435_9cd1e78459_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard but eventually I had to tear myself away from the comfortable bench and the sunshine. The final stage of the journey beckoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC5zr6" title="River Dee at Ballater by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Dee at Ballater" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/8940924755_37bd73d430_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crossing the Dee by the graceful stone bridge I left the road and wound my way along forest tracks, the afternoon sun filtered through lush green leaves. At the back entrance to the House of Glenmuick I picked up the vehicle track that climbs steadily alongside the woods and up to the summit of Pannanich Hill. After a couple of hours down in the glen it was good to get back up into the open spaces and now the hills of the Mounth stretched out in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC5wr8" title="Ascending Pannanich Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ascending Pannanich Hill" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8267/8940914665_a6ceb59745_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Pannanich Hill the familiar hills of Aberdeenshire - Bennachie, Hill of Fare and Kerloch - were seen, as well as the tower blocks on the west side of Aberdeen, just catching the sunlight on the edge of sight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the vehicle tracks south across Pannanich hill and then down through a wide flat basin below Knockie Branar and Cairn Leuchan to eventually reach the junction with the Mounth Road, marked by a clear sign pointing the way to Mount Keen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC4Zwz" title="Lochnagar from Pannanich Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lochnagar from Pannanich Hill" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8405/8940810697_e08992e15b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was a grassy trail through open swathes of long grass and crossing the occasional stream. It peaked at a gate with a metal cross that offered the first views into Glen Tanar and also back to the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC81QC" title="Summit of the Mounth Road by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of the Mounth Road" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8404/8941400444_3c10331fc7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The path now led down between heather and then contoured around the lower slopes of the hill heading gently downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC7Fid" title="Down the Mounth Road to Glen Tanar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Down the Mounth Road to Glen Tanar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3725/8941334706_56578452b4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC7BvA" title="Glen Tanar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Tanar" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/8941321968_733d04d62c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I dropped down to the Water of Tanar I spied two people lazing around by the ruins of the old croft near the footbridge that carries the Mounth road across toward Mount Keen. These turned out to be the fourth and fifth Challengers I had met on my Crossing. Ian and Christine Wright were from the Wirral and I enjoyed a pleasant chat with them whilst they set up their tent in the wonderful meadow that sits at this end of the glen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my planned route this was also to be my campsite for the night, and I’m sure it would have been wonderful, however it was only 5pm and I decided if I could make some inroads into the next day’s mileage it would allow me to break up the dreaded east coast road walk. I had intended to march from the hills to the coast in a day but was now a bit worried about rebellion from the feet over 20 miles of tarmac. In addition the weather forecast I got in Ballater indicated strengthening winds coming in on Wednesday night which would make a final high camp perhaps more than a little unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC7tPJ" title="Crossing the Water of Tanar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossing the Water of Tanar" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5326/8941296108_51fe07cc33_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was that I rather reluctantly bid farewell to Christine and Ian and headed down the Tanar slightly to a point where it was possible to pick my way across the river whilst maintaining dry feet. The landrover track took me up below Clachan Yell and at the junction near Broad Cairn I branched off to follow a track that wound its way down the lower slopes of Gathering Cairn towards the Wolf Grain stream. Eventually the track petered out and I picked a way across bog and heather, climbing up the slopes of the Hill of Gairney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC4eyP" title="Track leading east from Glen Tanar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track leading east from Glen Tanar" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5341/8940662811_c37554a0f9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC7k3h" title="The hills of the Mounth by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills of the Mounth" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7309/8941266560_b62bc9b785_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hard going after a long day and as I moved onward a thick grey cloud came over the sky casting a strange light across the hills of the Mounth. It was very reminiscent of the vapours that rise out of Mordor and send the lands into a lingering twilight in Lord of the Rings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC7gjq" title="View to Clachan Yell by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="View to Clachan Yell" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2854/8941254040_99fb190979_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC76Aw" title="On the Hill of Cat by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="On the Hill of Cat" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/8941221334_da1fa83b98_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tramp up to Cock Cairn was slow and steady but it was rewarding to see Mount Battock off in the distance. Away to the south the hills above Glen Esk were bathed in the warm glow of evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC3PZg" title="Hill of Cat by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hill of Cat" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7401/8940583493_7e4873efd5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC3xcK" title="Glen Esk hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Esk hills" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5325/8940527029_191978fe2e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I was though a strong breeze had gathered and so once I was on the eastern slopes of Cock Cairn I started to cast about for a sheltered spot. Everywhere was thick heather or bog and eventually I settled for a little cleared area on a raised island amongst a sea of heather. The tent fit almost perfectly, though I did a little landscaping to prevent the heather impaling the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eC6KWj" title="Wild camping above Glen Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camping above Glen Esk" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3722/8941155202_de621bd4ef_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the tent was up I had to walk about ten minutes further down the hill to the upper reaches of the East Grain where I was able to gather water. Back at the tent I was glad to cook up a dinner of soup, pasta and then super noodles, watching as the golden light over Glen Esk slowly faded. A cold wind continued to blow and it was another night of cosying up in the sleeping bag with my Kindle and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 12, Wednesday 22nd May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp below the Hill of Cat to North Water Bridge&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 30km (Total: 309km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Mount Battock (Corbett)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD4toF" title="Wild camp above Glen Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild camp above Glen Esk" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2861/8952025815_035862e068_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning was much better; the cloud had dispersed and it was sunshine that woke me as it crested the hill behind the tent. I was fairly well protected from the breeze but still ended up making breakfast in the tent porch as the wind was steadily rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDaFr9" title="Morning over Glen Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Morning over Glen Esk" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7459/8953236998_0426916168_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under bright sunshine I enjoyed packing up a dry tent and then made my way westward, starting what I expected would be the penultimate day. I crossed over the East Grain and then made my way onto the Hill of Cat and then to the flat summit of Tampie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDayEf" title="Across Glen Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Across Glen Esk" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7297/8953214210_6abbed999e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the summit there were glorious views in all directions but I was particularly excited to see, far off and shimmering in the golden morning light, the North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDajpL" title="Shimmering Sea by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Shimmering Sea" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8259/8953166274_899a5f3d35_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I approached the Fungle Road (crossed with the Stockets &lt;a href="/blog/2008/03/the-fungle-road/"&gt;back in February 2008&lt;/a&gt;) I knew I was getting into electric fence territory, and sure enough the first one appeared. There was a gate in the corner which I used and this took me down through the enclosure until another gate took me back out from where it was an easy descent down to the Fungle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD497M" title="Towards the Hill of Wirren by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Hill of Wirren" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7438/8951960977_156363ca77_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the track a short way to make use of the big gate here and then left the track to climb up the delightfully named Mudlee Bracks, at first following a deer path, but then joining a landrover track higher up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD9QSJ" title="Mount Keen beyond the Firmounth by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Keen beyond the Firmounth" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7319/8953073646_1d3bc3aff9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD9MuJ" title="Mount Battock by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mount Battock" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8953062278_2bf2ff5c49_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Battock was by now looking closer and I followed the rise of the hill up and onto the Hill of Cammie where another electric fence was crossed. This led to a steep drop down into the narrow glen containing the Tennet with the slopes of Mount Battock rising steeply on the far side. I spotted a couple of figures with big bags making their way up on the other side of the fence. My side had a faint track which I followed up on wet grass, glad to top out on the ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD9Ezb" title="Summit of Mount Battock by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Mount Battock" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/8953038988_c866740df0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at just short of 800m it was clear that the wind was much stronger and it was very difficult to make progress towards the summit of the hill. The fierce wind blew me off course continually but eventually I made it to the top where I caught up with the two Challengers. They took a quick break in the wind shelter before carrying on towards the Fettereso forest. I took a few moments to enjoy the solitude, gazing out east towards the sea and across Glen Esk to the Hill of Wirren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Mount Battock I could now see the final hills of the Crossing. I descended by the steep, boggy path on the eastern side of the hill, eventually joining the landrover track that runs down towards Glen Esk across the Hill of Saughs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD33j6" title="Descent from Mount Battock by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent from Mount Battock" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7423/8951746337_aea9e861f3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD2Tji" title="Track to Glen Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track to Glen Esk" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/8951716073_a480f9a14e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsure of the exact routing of this track I eventually left it and crossed a fence to then clomp through the heather and up past a few grouse butts to reach the flat summit of the Hill of Fingray. The wind was now a continual presence and walking was quite difficult at times but the views were stunning with Clachnaben now off to my left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD2MrZ" title="Towards Glen Dye by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glen Dye" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/8951696335_007834e948_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final plod over the Shank of Mondair, Murmannoch and then up towards Craigancash seemed to take forever and the terrain was unrelentingly awkward until the very summit of the hill. I found myself again on the wrong side of a fence and crossed it to reach another track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD8Bvb" title="Boggy by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boggy" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8952833552_3920b406a7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started heading slightly north the weather caught up with me and a fierce hailstorm was unleashed. Even through my trousers and waterproofs the stinging was horrible and so I hunkered down behind a boulder to let it pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD85L9" title="Light and dark by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light and dark" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/8952730136_ba32d1bc8c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD7PrY" title="Hailstorm by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hailstorm" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/8952678622_ef04c4d4a2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon the sun was shining again and I made my way along the track towards Sturdy Hill, determined to “bag” this final trig point before making my way down. I left the track and climbed up through peat and heather only to the find that the trig point was on the other side of the fence!! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD1DWi" title="Clachnaben from Sturdy Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clachnaben from Sturdy Hill" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7426/8951475953_4a840e2195_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another shower was fast approaching so I gazed winsomely at the trig point but couldn’t be bothered to cross the fence. I quickly retreated a short way and found another spot to shelter as a second fierce hail storm passed through. This time I had my lunch whilst it passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD7H1m" title="Track on Sturdy Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track on Sturdy Hill" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7457/8952656952_333533dfd7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the sunshine reappeared and I dropped back down only to find that the track I was on petered out and that a completely independent track now wound away in the direction I wanted to go, only on the other side of a fence!!!! I crossed this last obstacle and followed the fence as it wound its way around the head of a wide coire. I crawled under a dilapidated fence and then made a swift descent down to a track that ran out of the coire of Black Goit and eastward across low hills to the plain beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD1wYv" title="Storm cloud over the Mearns by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Storm cloud over the Mearns" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5334/8951452533_1817cab49f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final hail storm caught me on this track and once again I sheltered behind a high bank but it was over as quickly as it started and I now made easy progress along the last of the undulations, enjoying the expansive views out across the Mearns. I dropped down through the woods of Balfour, passed the odd collection of buildings at Easter Balfour and finally emerged onto a minor road under a bright spring sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD7gJJ" title="Track from Black Goit by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track from Black Goit" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/8952571946_0cc5ca52bf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was early afternoon and I now had a fair few miles of tarmac ahead of me. On the next smaller road I stopped to try and eject as much grit and dirt out of my socks as possible and to remove my waterproofs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCZPXR" title="Looking across the Mearns by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across the Mearns" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/8951314571_1ba2d79695_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCZCMM" title="Heavy Electricity by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Heavy Electricity" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/8951276983_93d663ef41_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next couple of hours was a bit of a plod but the farmland was pleasant and it was interesting to see some of the huge houses out this way. I wound hither and thither, trying to take the most direct route without going down what I thought might be farmyard lanes that could involve dogs (I’m not a dog person at all). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD6udW" title="Showers over the Mearns by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers over the Mearns" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2844/8952418838_7b9d31acf9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I joined a busier road that led me down towards North Water Bridge. The weather held most of the way and it was only as I entered the woods near Edzell that rain started. However, the wind continued to be incredibly strong, blowing straight down off the hills and over the exposed farmland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eD6pPq" title="Rainbow over the Mearns by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over the Mearns" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5450/8952404018_87498c1d2c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to finally reach the road junction just before the roar of the A90 from where I could see the cheerful flags marking the entrance to the campsite at North Water Bridge. I trundled down the final stretch of road and was very glad to be at a sensible resting point, with the coast now a very achievable distance away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it was that I entered the campsite. This was certainly a new experience. I’ve never been to a campsite in my life (a music festival on an island in the Danube just north of Budapest doesn’t really count) so it was all quite exciting. £6 paid, a nod in the direction of the other tents, a nod towards the toilet and shower block, and that was that. I seemed to be somewhere in the middle of the arriving pack and so had plenty of spots to choose from. The grass was beautifully green and short and very nearly level and I chose a nice spot next to a tree. The Scarp went up and with a good breeze I had all the vents open to give it a final air out before the end of the Challenge. This was all very novel, particularly after the lumpy, heathery pitch near the Hill of Cat the night before!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eCZfxV" title="Camped at North Water Bridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camped at North Water Bridge" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8413/8951202171_29f55f0980_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was getting sorted out the famous trio of &lt;a href="http://alansloman.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Alan Sloman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://akkwalks.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Andrew Walker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blog.doodlecat.com/"&gt;Phil Lambert&lt;/a&gt; arrived. I had to put my sunglasses back on as a bright yellow Solomid and bright yellow Trailstar were pitched next to me. Later on James Boulter of &lt;a href="https://backpackingbongos.wordpress.com/"&gt;Backpackingbongos&lt;/a&gt; found me via Twitter and we had a brief but pleasant chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the sunshine as the evening progressed it became increasingly chilly and there was a strong wind gusting through the site. After a heavy shower around tea time it dried up and a few people ventured out for some sociability. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed by the people and the transition from hill to tarmac had made for a tiring day so I ended up in my sleeping bag quite early on where I read of few chapters of Roger Deakin’s &lt;em&gt;Wildwood&lt;/em&gt; before drifting off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now just a few easy road miles from the coast at St Cyrus and happy to be about to finish my Challenge around half a day ahead of schedule.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="tgoc"></category><category term="tgo challenge"></category><category term="tgo challenge 2013"></category><category term="cairngorms"></category><category term="mounth"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>TGO Challenge 2013 : Part 2</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/06/tgoc-part-2/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-06-01T21:08:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-06-01T21:08:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-06-01:/blog/2013/06/tgoc-part-2/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;_In May 2013 I backpacked across Scotland.

&lt;h2&gt;Day 6, Thursday 16th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Fort Augustus to Wild Camp below Geal Charn&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 30km (Total 135km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Meall na h-Aisre (Corbett), Geal Charn (Munro)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Fort Augustus the previous afternoon, I’d been keen to move on, and probably wouldn’t have minded just continuing on with the wild camping, especially in the face of so many coach parties. However, the comfortable sleep, hot shower and delicious cooked breakfast at Three Bridges really changed that. Feeling more than adequately fed, and both clean and rested, it was in high spirits that I set off from Fort Augustus into the morning sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I passed a couple of &lt;a href="http://www.greatglenway.com/"&gt;Great Glen Way&lt;/a&gt; walkers heading through the village and as the crowds turned south on their way to Invergarry, I headed east along a quiet B road running along the south shore of Loch Ness. The trees and fields were a lush green and white clouds hung over the water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ew1zKo" title="South shore of Loch Ness by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="South shore of Loch Ness" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3776/8872246392_bab04c35a8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road climbed the hill and at the entrance to Glendoe Lodge I took up the forest track which I thought would allow me to miss out some small sections of road walking. It indeed did this but not in the way I expected and after some time I realised I was on a different track to my planned route! It did offer some grand views back across the loch to Fort Augustus and further down the Great Glen to the Loch Lochy hills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ew1xZS" title="Fort Augustus and Loch Ness by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Fort Augustus and Loch Ness" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8551/8872240504_3bbd958df8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued up through the gloomy pines looking at the map and pondering my options. Luckily as the slopes to my right eased I was able to pick a way through the thinning woods and found myself on the tarmac driveway leading away from Glendoe Lodge having cut off a corner of the incorrect track. Soon I was back on the road and then turning off it again to pick up the construction road which leads up to the Glendoe Reservoir. Now I was back on course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A light grey cloud had by now filled up the sky and it, coupled with the relentless grey of the road, made for a sombre walk up into Coire Doe, following the tamed course of the Allt Doe. Occasional rises would give views down the Great Glen towards Loch Lochy but it wasn’t really until I gained the height that both the weather and views improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ew1uHN" title="Small reservoir below Borlum Hill by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Small reservoir below Borlum Hill" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5447/8872229480_a64c220a86_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Near the high point of the road the sun finally emerged and I stepped away from the craggy moor land dropping down to Loch Ness and across into a different world altogether. Stretched out before me north and east lay the wild hills of the Monadh Liath, the grey mountains, which sit across Strath Spey from their better known cousins, the Monadh Ruadh, or the red mountains of the Cairngorms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evWsX2" title="Across the Monadhliath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Across the Monadhliath" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3814/8871443071_cc52f848d5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under a huge sky the hills disappeared into the distance, only broken by the deep notch of Glen Markie. Far off were the bigger hills that mark the edge of the high escarpment on the west of Speyside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evZpcs" title="The Monadhliath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Monadhliath" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3800/8872015788_8d23da3b27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I followed the vehicle track as it wound down to the Glendoe Reservoir and then stopped for lunch near one of the streams feeding this steely expanse of water which sits up near the 800m contour. The sculptured banks of the stream provided a comfortable sitting area with enough height to shelter me from a bitterly cold wind. The feet aired whilst I munched on oatcakes, cheese and salami, all “fresh” from Fort Augustus the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evVUnH" title="Marshy pools near Glendoe Reservoir by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marshy pools near Glendoe Reservoir" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5446/8871333491_a74e728ccc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a morning on tracks I was now facing an afternoon of heather, bog and peat hags. It started well with a gentle climb up to Meall Caca which brought with it views of the nearby Corbett Gairbeinn, as well as the complicated network of peaks and lochans that I aimed to navigate through to reach Meall na h-Aisre, my intended Corbett summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evVPxv" title="Towards Glen Markie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Glen Markie" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7349/8871317239_42c6ba7d6c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a bearing for Lochan Iain I followed it as best I could through the myriad waterways, pools and marshes and in fact mostly made forward progress and mostly kept my feet dry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evYBmf" title="Some fairly extensive bog by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Some fairly extensive bog" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8871861554_437dffef96_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the ground started to rise and I made swifter progress up to a little prominence on the southwestern shoulder of the the Corbett. After more showers the sun was back out and I relaxed, removing waterproofs and taking the time to look out across the upper reaches of the Spey. Nearby was Garva Bridge, a popular stopping point for Challengers en route to Laggan and Speyside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evYv5N" title="Towards the Spey by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards the Spey" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8417/8871840474_4e9c5c805a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final gentle slopes were easy enough on short, springy heather and the summit plateau with trig and cairn soon hove into view. Although the wide expanse of the plateau largely robbed me of views I was pleased to see the Munro of Gael Charn looking quite close by now and also. The weather now seemed set to be pleasant for a while and I lounged about under the blue skies and sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evYgz7" title="Gael Charn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gael Charn" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7343/8871795020_e8b46cb524_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragging myself away from the summit of Meall na h-Aisre took me across a minor top and then down an interesting snow slope to reach the craggy summit of Creag an Lochain Dubh sitting above another area of marsh and bog which gaurded this northwestern approach to Gael Charn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking there might be another precipitous snow slope on this hill I headed slightly south to reach the valley and then picked my way through various grades of swampy ground to reach the Feith Talagain. The water was running swift and cold but it was an easy boulder hop and after refilling my water bottle I headed up the broad northwestern ridge of Gael Charn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evXuth" title="Feith Talagain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Feith Talagain" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2877/8871643302_cb30416a27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I met a path and followed this up the final slopes, which were a mixture of melting snow and little streams, to reach the plateau. The Munro summit at 3,038ft was marked by a large cairn across the plateau and I made it just on 5pm as a gorgeous evening light suffused the hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evX5f1" title="Adverikie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adverikie" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5323/8871561796_ffcc1e74b3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bittersweet moment. After a notion of hitting my half way Munro in the spectacular hills of Knoydart last August was foiled by the weather, and then a plan for it to be on the Munros of Affric earlier in the Challenge was again weather affected, it came down to Gael Charn, an unassuming Munro at the southern end of the Monadhliath escarpment to be my 141st and halfway Munro. Just another 141 to bag now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evTq9H" title="Summit of Gael Charn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Gael Charn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2820/8870848321_cb667075c5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening was warm and as I sat snacking I watched showers play out over the Ardverikie Hills and the bulk of Creag Meagaidh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evWL9J" title="Gael Charn summit plateau by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gael Charn summit plateau" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3815/8871500938_6a35b11ee1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My sojourn was broken by a new shower which seemed heavier and darker than the rest and was making straight for me from the east. I packed up and retraced my steps across the plateau and down to the col. A quick scout around below the ridge found a perfect spot with springy moss to pitch on and what I hoped would be a grandstand view if the weather cleared. As I pitched the tent it started hailing, &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evTmBB" title="Hailstorm by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Hailstorm" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7371/8870836425_39892eb97b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the tent up I jumped inside to shelter from the stinging shower. It lasted ten or fifteen minutes but as it relented I headed back out to pick up water from the stream above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evWpwU" title="Light in Glen Roy by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light in Glen Roy" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3676/8871431580_9943e5b720_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the tent I relaxed with a cuppa (I even had a wee pot of UHT milk from the B&amp;amp;B - something sorely missing from the first four camps) as the sun came back out. The view revealed by the retreating clouds lived up to expectations and I spent a happy evening watching the changing light over the surrounding hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/evT7mg" title="Sun shines over my camp by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sun shines over my camp" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/8870788439_a4dfa14dca_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At around 8pm the strangest thing happened. I was listening to a podcast as I cooked and ate but even through my headphones I couldn’t help but notice the clear female voice raised in song that drifted down from the direction of Gael Charn. It was an otherworldly experience as the voice faded out and then some fifteen or twenty minutes later faded back in. I deduced that it was perhaps a fellow Challenger who had been up Gael Charn and was now seeking out a stopping place for the night. Again the song faded away and despite getting up and looking about I didn’t see its owner who must have kept to the ridge some distance behind and above my tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sunset approached a little more cloud built and this helped in bringing about a dramatic end to the day, especially beyond the jagged crest of the North West Highlands where a red sun set beyond orange mountains. A crescent moon had risen and with the tent doors open to the cool night air I drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day dawned bright and sunny and I dozed in until the tent was too warm to stand. Coffee and granola bars were consumed for breakfast in the porch looking out over a sunny world. It looked to be a great day to tackle the rest of the Monadhliath Munros and get towards my next re-supply point of Aviemore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewUDBR" title="Creag Meagaidh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creag Meagaidh" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8415/8882405235_831719623d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Packed up and away I followed the easy undulating ridge northeast, picking off a number of rounded summits that led slowly towards Carn Dearg. Soon after starting I came across an Akto pitched in a hollow. Sure enough there was singing coming from inside! For the rest of the day, for no particular reason, I had Neil Young’s &lt;em&gt;The Old Laughing Lady&lt;/em&gt; stuck in my head...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewXJho" title="Rolling moorland of the Monadhliath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rolling moorland of the Monadhliath" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/8883006262_bdc4b9945f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground alternated between easy heather and stone and the occasional arduous tract of peat bog and it took a long time for Carn Dearg, the next Munro, to get any closer. Behind me Gael Charn merged into the background of snow streaked mountains and out across the Monadhliath clouds came and went against a blue sky. An occasional snow patch livened up progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later I was on the subsidiary top to Carn Dearg and followed the cornice-lined cliffs along eastward to reach the Munro summit, marked by a modest cairn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewWV6E" title="Adverickie Hills and Gael Charn by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adverickie Hills and Gael Charn" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2805/8882847532_9218d2a2f1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the cliffs the amphitheater of Gleann Bealach revealed itself with the other two Monadhliath Munros visible across the far side. Just as I reached the summit the first other walker I had seen on the entire trip also came up to the cairn. He turned out to be a Challenger who had started from Oban. After a brief chat he moved on and I stayed to enjoy elevenses on this high perch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught the Challenger up as he stopped for lunch in a sheltered dip a short way beyond the next hill. The route here was easy, following the baggers path around the head of the glen which in turn followed a set of rusting fence posts. After clouding up a little earlier the day had improved and pretty soon it was perfect spring weather with white clouds drifting through on a gentle breeze.  There was still some snow around though and Lochan Uisge remained semi-frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewSZhB" title="Light and shadows over the Monadhliath by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Light and shadows over the Monadhliath" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/8882081175_36d02d6022_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intermediary peaks came and went and soon enough I was dropping down through peat and bog to the dishearteningly low point between Carn Suglain and A’ Chailleach, the two northerly Munros. In a steep sided notch the Allt Cuil na Chailleach was crossed with care having negotiated the steep grassy bank. Suddenly there were lots of people about although it seemed like these were day trippers, plodding on towards the next Munro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewVU85" title="Towards A' Chailleach and Carn Sgùlain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards A' Chailleach and Carn Sgùlain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/8882649138_85e91490d1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to get the summit of A’ Chailleach to myself - it was a stiff slog up but a path eventually appeared and led me to the rocky cairn. From here I got my first close up look at the Cairngorms as the views across Speyside opened up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewVDCW" title="Cairngorms and Speyside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cairngorms and Speyside" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3715/8882600410_6fc7b97ac9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused here for lunch, watching the tiny figures of other walkers head up to Carn Sgulain and across to Gael Charn. The windbreak offered good shelter for cheese and salami and oatcakes munched on in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewSefB" title="Summit cairn of A' Chailleach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit cairn of A' Chailleach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7328/8881933043_7232d343dc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I returned across the depressing notch, this time skirting further south to avoid the steepest slopes and then followed the high ground to the summit of Carn Sgulain, the fourth and final Munro in the Monadhliath. The weather was holding and with the wind to my back I now made good progress continuing north and east. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewVkSJ" title="Monadhliath Mountains by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Monadhliath Mountains" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8404/8882540658_8f978ebcf8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I crossed below the summit of Carn a’ Bhothain Mholaich and dropped down into the coire containing the headwaters of the Dulnain the clouds started to thicken and the weather felt changeable. I followed a landrover track and then took to more open heather to reach the summit of another Corbett, Carn an Fhreicadain, passing a large cairn just before the main summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewRQyM" title="Looking back to the Monadhliath Munros by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back to the Monadhliath Munros" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8542/8881856725_b15a62416c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewRN5v" title="Carn an Fhreicedain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn an Fhreicedain" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/8881848357_263d97d44a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this top there was an easy landrover track to follow on a winding route down and up to Beinn Bhreac which offered fine views to the northern Monadhlaith. However, the weather was definitely closing in and so I didn’t waste too much time on the summit but instead picked out a route down to the distant Allt Mor which cuts northwest into the hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewRBc6" title="North towards Aviemore by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="North towards Aviemore" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3746/8881811735_9a82262c98_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ground was uneven and boggy but eventually I reached the start of this stream and followed it down until I came to a pleasingly level area of close cropped turf. Again I got the tent up just as the first drops of rain started falling and a blustery wind picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewRs2D" title="Monadhliath Camping by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Monadhliath Camping" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/8881780911_7d5bdf7ac3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained on and off throughout the evening and each time I looked out the cloud had dropped lower. Having fetched water I proceeded to enjoy a relaxed evening though, well sheltered from the weather and as darkness fell I finished off Krakauer’s &lt;em&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/em&gt; and then headed off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/ewRiTt" title="Camping by the Allt Mor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping by the Allt Mor" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/8881753525_60f73f9a18_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 8, Saturday 18th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp by Allt Mor to the Aviemore Youth Hostel&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 21km (Total 184km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Gael-charn Mor (Corbett)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started cold and grey with the cloud level only just above the tent. I had a relatively easy day ahead of me, with a night in Aviemore planned, and so had a slow breakfast, waiting until the last minute to pack up the wet tent. An occasional shower of rain would come and go but it was more drizzly than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had a short distance of wet ground to negotiate before I picked up the landrover track that drops down besides the Allt Mor, eventually crossing the stream by a tidy estate building where the stream turned to drop down into the waters of the River Dulnain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Somewhere in the Monadhliath" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YpoM1yorUhk/UaJpN3ueTKI/AAAAAAAAB5w/ZQ23lNLuMjo/w1024-h768-no/IMG_20130518_102119.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than following the water I now climbed into the mist, following a track around and below A’ Bhuidheanaich that would eventually rise to cross a pass down towards Kincraig. I wasn’t going to hit Speyside just yet though and now had a short period of micronavigation ahead. Rising up to the top of the ridge close to Carn Coire Dhugain brought me into unpleasant wind, cloud and more persistent rain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stoically set a bearing and followed the compass across lumpen, boggy ground, neogtiationg a shallow coire until I picked up another vehicle track heading to Carn an Fhurain Duibh. It was all rather grim in the steady drizzle that was falling. Eventually this track petered out below the steep north-western slope of Gael Charn Beag which I clambered up, picking a way between unstable fields of boulders and slick grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once up the steep section, the summit of Gael-charn Beag was quickly reached and then it was fairly easy to follow the rise of the hill up to the Corbett smummit of Gael-charn Mor. Two figures and a dog were leaving the cairn just as I arrived but I got a wave as they headed off into the thick clag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped here for an early lunch before following them down the eatsern side of the hill. This brought me down to the distinctive red gravel of the Burma road, another way down to Speyside. I didn’t fancy the crossing of the A9 so decided to face a last section of misty hillwalking. This took me around below another Gael-charn Beag until I picked up a stream that I followed down the hillside. The wind eased and eventually I dropped below the cloud. It was still raining though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had trouble locating the marked path but perservered, crossing a high deer fence and then following the upper boundary of a plantation across boggy ground until I finally found a clear track heading down the north side of Milton Burn. Grateful for the clear way forward, and the better shelter under the trees I made good progress down hill, crossing one deer fence by a high stile and before too long emerging out, somewhat unsettlingly, in the back of a new housing estate in Aviemore. I used the handy underpass to get across the A9 and then followed the streets down to Aviemore’s main road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this point that the rain really started and I had a damp trudge down the road to the &lt;a href="http://mountaincafe-aviemore.co.uk/"&gt;Mountain Cafe&lt;/a&gt; where I felt a little guilty joining the queue of neatly dressed folk waiting for a table. This was all washed away once I had a table and got a steaming bowl of soup, a delicious wrap and a huge cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beetroot and Carrot Cake" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9U99cz3xynk/UaJpN9qZpUI/AAAAAAAAB5s/qu7NC5ttALI/w1024-h768-no/IMG_20130518_162258.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dessert I went for a cup of tea and the biggest slice of carrot and chocolate cake ever seen, and wiled away the time watching the world go by outside and catching up on messages. It was in this way that I learnt that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlintyRich"&gt;Rich&lt;/a&gt; had taken a day off in Aviemore and that I had caught him up. Soon enough he came down from the Youth Hostel and we had a quick catch up, comparing notes on our respective Challenges so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tea and cake done I headed to Tesco to resupply, amusing Rich with some of my choices, and then went down to the &lt;a href="http://www.syha.org.uk/hostels-in-scotland/highlands/aviemore.aspx"&gt;Youth Hostel&lt;/a&gt; to check into my plush (!) single room. A hot shower and a chance to change out of well worn clothes was very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening we headed down to the &lt;a href="http://www.oldbridgeinn.co.uk/"&gt;Old Bridge Inn&lt;/a&gt; where a fine dinner was washed down by good Cairngorm Brewery Ale, routes were compared and a plan was decided upon for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the Youth Hostel I put a call into home (having already updated Challenge Control on my progress before dinner) and then headed for bed, confident that everything would be dried out and that all my electronics would be fully charged...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aviemore felt like a good milestone to reach. The hills would now be much more familiar and the east coast seemed like an achiveable target, especially with the promise of good weather for the next couple of long days in the Cairngorms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="tgoc"></category><category term="tgo challenge"></category><category term="tgo challenge 2013"></category><category term="monadhliath"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>TGO Challenge 2013 : Part 1</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-1/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-27T20:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-27T20:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-05-27:/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-1/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In May 2013 I backpacked across Scotland. This is part one of the trip report which covers the days from Plockton to Fort Augustus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it all began last year when, one bright September afternoon, I crossed the sunny concourse of Aberdeen Railway Station and bought a copy of the October issue of &lt;a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/"&gt;TGO Magazine&lt;/a&gt; from the newsagents. There towards the back was an application form which I dutifully filled in, laying out my recent experiences of wild camping and hillwalking in Scotland. I mailed it off and sat back, waiting hopefully like so many others for the thud of a heavy brown envelope signalling good news. In the meantime I took my big map of Scotland and started sketching out a couple of possible routes. I was already starting to dream of May 2013 and setting out on the 34th &lt;a href="http://www.tgomagazine.co.uk/tgochallenge/"&gt;TGO Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was therefore somewhat of a disappointment that, coming back to my flat on a particularly dark and cold November evening, I found only a thin brown envelope waiting for me on the doormat. I hadn’t succeeded in gaining one of the 300 coveted places and instead had been placed on the standby list. The idea with this is that as people who have a place on the event have to drop out (for whatever reason), then people from the standby list graduate to the main event and the final participant number stays around 300. A quick e-mail to the Challenge co-ordinator, John Manning, confirmed that I was number 16 on the standby list. Apparently the list is a fickle thing with some years many people gaining a place, whereas in other years barely half a dozen people graduate. Being a little bit in no-mans land at 16 I put thoughts of the TGO Challenge on the back-burner and started planning some alternative trips for Spring, including an alternative to the Cape Wrath Trail which would take me north from Torridon through Fisherfield and then Assynt and Sutherland to wind up somewhere on the north coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until late February 2013 that I once again thought of the TGO Challenge. This time it was an e-mail from John Manning alerting me to the fact that I was now at number three on the stand-by list and that if I was still thinking of participating, I should start getting a route planned. All of a sudden dreams of the Far North vanished and I brushed off the digital dust from one of the routes I had sketched out back in October. As it was too late to get the first Friday off work I knew I would be starting on the Saturday and so an easily accessible start point was required. I love the village of Plockton and since it is easy to get to on the Kyle of Lochalsh railway line my choice was made. I now started fleshing out the route and transferring it onto the route sheet. John’s e-mail confirming my place came through on 1st March and just a few days later my route sheet was on its way to be vetted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nervous wait ensued but soon I had comments back from my vetter. There was no problem with my Main Route but I did have to tweak my &lt;em&gt;Foul Weather Alternative&lt;/em&gt; in a couple of places to comply with the Challenge’s safety requirements (basically FWAs should avoid going over ground above 500m and should be easily navigable without difficult or complex terrain). This was quickly addressed and with my route now accepted I could now start pulling together &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/tgoc-gear-list/"&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt;, food and maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April turned into a very busy month and after squeezing in a last minute &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/"&gt;two night trip to Ardgour&lt;/a&gt; it was suddenly May and the week before the Challenge. There was a final flurry of purchases and then an evening spent dividing up food, packing and repacking the bag, and highlighting routes on various map print-outs. After a strange Friday where I &lt;a href="http://www.shareyouradventure.com/map/os/socialhiking/TGO-Challenge-2013-unofficial"&gt;used Social Hiking to watch other participants&lt;/a&gt; set off from their respective start points from my office desk I was all ready for departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Route&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the following map to explore my route which was mostly generated from beacons sent by my Spot messenger during the course of my Crossing. The green line shows my initial planned route whilst the orange line shows the actual course I took.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 1, Saturday 11th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: &lt;a href="https://www.invertedworld.co.uk/hillwalking/hillwalk/461"&gt;View on OS Maps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:14am, Aberdeen Railway Station. At this point I’m pretty confident that I was about the most easterly Challenger. Happily the train left on time and in a carriage occupied by just one other person I drifted in and out of sleep as we rumbled along the line to Inverness. Nerves mixed with the very early start didn’t really dissipate until a large coffee and croissant in Inverness from where my train to Kyle of Lochalsh departed promptly at 9am. The entertainment on this leg was provided by a young lady on her way to Kyle for a birthday party whose mates were driving across the country and pausing occasionally by the side of the road to wave to her as we clickity-clacked passed in the train. Meanwhile I finished off Murakami’s &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt; and spent long stretches gazing out at the passing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqRiWj" title="Plockton by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plockton" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/8813854714_5d3cfb9cf0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon the glorious west coast scenery was filling the train windows on either side and we pulled into Plockton where I was one of only two passengers to alight. Plockton is perhaps an unusual start point for a coast-to-coast in that it’s picturesque bay faces east. Because of this I felt that to truly start on the west coast I should seek out one of the beaches or bays that sits across the headland from the village, rather than dipping my toes in the waters of Plockton Harbour. This short diversion west proved to be straightforward, at least until I came across a whole herd of cattle being moved between fields. After getting the nod from the farmer I waded through the ooze, mucking up my shiny new trail shoes, and then descended down a rocky path to reach Port Luinge, a quiet inlet with magnificent views out across the channel to Skye, its dramatic hills wreathed in cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epVsar" title="Port Luinge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Port Luinge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/8803346339_0d689ec81a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pack down I dipped my toes into the sea and then spent a few moments sitting on the shore gazing out across the water and thinking about what was in front of me. Adventure and really wild things! Had I packed my towel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqREnL" title="Dipping my toe in the west coast waters by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dipping my toe in the west coast waters" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7427/8813923470_6d3d0da7c1_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all that though I had to locate the TGO Challenge sign-out register. This tells the organisers that you have left your departure point as planned and in Plockton was located in the reception of the Plockton Hotel. I renegotiated cow alley, skirted the airfield and then walked down the road into the village. In the sunshine the tourists were out in force but the hotel itself was quiet. I found the register and discovered I was last to sign out in Plockton - everyone else had departed early the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqRNpb" title="View from the Plockton Hotel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="View from the Plockton Hotel" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/8813950464_b1eabe8dd8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epVG7B" title="Signing out at the Plockton Hotel by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Signing out at the Plockton Hotel" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/8803393271_3870287d3d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After signing out I took my first few steps of the Challenge... along the corridor to the bar where I ordered a pint and lunch. This is surely the only way to get across Scotland! I sat enjoying my lunch and talking to a very friendly couple from Dorset who were motorbiking around the Highlands. They wished me luck and after polishing off lunch I stepped outside to get on with the serious task at hand. With my &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2012/07/spot-messenger-2-review/"&gt;Spot device&lt;/a&gt; enabled, a map in my trouser pocket and a refilled water bottle I was off into the sunshine to seek out the first path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epVTZ4" title="Plockton from the coastal path by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plockton from the coastal path" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2885/8803433201_44cddb1d37_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was straightforward and turned out to be a delightful path leading alongside the southern side of Plockton harbour, turning round about little headlands and then passing under the railway line and climbing up through woods to the main road. I passed a girl out walking her dog and paused a few times to enjoy the peaceful surrounds. The afternoon train rumbled by as I climbed away from the shore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqSdaU" title="Clear waters of Plockton Harbour by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clear waters of Plockton Harbour" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5343/8814030430_6b2ee46584_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a very short road-walking interlude I was on a forestry track which gained more height and offered superb views back down to Plockton and across Loch Carron to the hills of Applecross. The skies were blue but there were showery clouds lingering in the background and the higher hills remained shrouded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epW7YT" title="Looking down to Plockton and the Applecross Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down to Plockton and the Applecross Hills" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/8803476923_667916b5e8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to be out on the Saturday as the forestry workings were quiet and I slipped easily around the abandoned Brachiosauric felling machines. The crags on either side of the Bealach Mòr stood out against the bright sky and it was only as I dropped to the loch near the dwelling at Sean-chreag that the first clouds started to fill the sky above me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqSrkj" title="Carn a Bhealaich Mhoir and Carn an Reidh Bhric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Carn a Bhealaich Mhoir and Carn an Reidh Bhric" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3823/8814074708_3356705c12_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqSv73" title="Descending towards Sean-chreag by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descending towards Sean-chreag" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5441/8814087394_4c0dbe3dfc_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a brief investigation of the ruins of a hill fort I turned east here, picking up a boggy track that wound its way above the burn, passing the sad remains of a recently expired deer, and then climbing up towards the notched pass of Gleannan Dorch. The path continued up to a deer fence but then mysteriously disappeared. To one side of the fence it was short stumpy woodland, and on the other it was charred heather. I chose the woodland side and spent a difficult forty-five minutes bushwhacking my way upstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epWtZT" title="Upper Gleannan Dorch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Upper Gleannan Dorch" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/8803547625_6d84940391_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epWzap" title="Looking back down Gleannan Dorch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back down Gleannan Dorch" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7324/8803564997_776303fa15_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was at this time that a light drizzle started falling and I decided to don waterproofs. After a few dead ends and one or two moments where I thought I had torn my waterproofs on briar branches I finally emerged above the craggy head of the glen and onto easier ground. Ahead of me across the moor was Beinn Raimh, my first listed summit of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqT6MS" title="Climbing out of Gleannan Dorch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Climbing out of Gleannan Dorch" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2843/8814204080_1f802bab28_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTanY" title="Auchtertyre Hill from Beinn Raimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Auchtertyre Hill from Beinn Raimh" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2857/8814216150_9efe52fdea_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A faint path led me across the pass and then over a stretch of high, boggy moorland below Letter Hill to reach the easy climb up to the summit of Beinn Raimh. The rain turned heavier as I reached the summit but I enjoyed sitting for a moment enjoying the views out to Skye, up Loch Carron and towards Affric as the hills flitted in and out between breaks in the heavy cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epWYxe" title="Looking towards Skye from Beinn Raimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking towards Skye from Beinn Raimh" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/8803643635_1f73bda9f2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epX3Na" title="Loch Carron from Beinn Raimh by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Carron from Beinn Raimh" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2806/8803657957_53ca582949_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent to the main road from Beinn Raimh was steep and slippery in wet conditions and largely pathless but I picked a way down and emerged on the military road that runs parallel with the somewhat more modern A 890. I followed the old road uphill until it became too overgrown and then dropped down to the grassy verge of the main road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTutL" title="Descending to the A890 and the Lochalsh Dam by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descending to the A890 and the Lochalsh Dam" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/8814280402_98b0fd9712_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t too busy and soon enough I was at the turn-off for the forestry road leading into Gleann Udalain. By this time the rain had stopped and I paused at the gate to remove waterproofs. The way down Gleann Udalain was easy going and I enjoyed the emerging sunshine as it illuminated the hills which featured impressive coires and waterfalls on this northern side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTyLd" title="Walking through Glen Udalain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking through Glen Udalain" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5460/8814294812_4319a8a635_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epXo7p" title="The hills south of Glen Udalain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills south of Glen Udalain" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/8803722931_5a78e3852a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew from my vetter’s comments that the deer fence running along this glen could be problematic, particularly in the upper reaches, and so when a gate appeared I made use of it, fording the river and cutting off a corner of my planned route by ascending to an unnamed pass between two unnamed humps. Emerging on the top of the bealach I was greeted by the sight of the dark flanks of the Killilan hills under deep blue skies as sunshine swept across the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTFzq" title="Looking back to Glen Udalain by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking back to Glen Udalain" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/8814317734_27b7477caf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTKMQ" title="Killilan Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Killilan Hills" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/8814331910_28649f95a2_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bealach led me to a delightful stretch of heather moorland which took me past Loch Innis nan Seangan and then to the lumpy hill of Carn na h-Onaich where I intended to camp for the night. There was one final quite high deer fence to get across and then I was up the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqTXAf" title="Loch Innis nan Seangan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Innis nan Seangan" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/8814371606_4d0cc300a5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqU1D7" title="Crossing the high moorland towards the River Ling by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Crossing the high moorland towards the River Ling" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/8814381864_498f122d7d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From one of the many craggy summits I enjoyed the sunlit views across the hills of Kintail and down towards the green sweep of land around Killilan at the head of Loch Long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epXZVc" title="Creag Dharach and Loch na h-Onaich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Creag Dharach and Loch na h-Onaich" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5339/8803843385_969f4c9891_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now the wind had picked up and it was a blustery evening as I hunted around for a pitch. Eventually I found a sheltered spot behind a jumbled granite tor and soon had the tent up for my first wild camp of the Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/epYhD8" title="Wild Camping above the River Ling by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping above the River Ling" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3699/8803899641_63d152b47a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening was spectacular with the light shifting behind clouds, illuminating the surrounding hills and lighting up the western sea. I enjoyed dinner and sat up on the tor with a mug of hot chocolate reflecting back on a great first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqUQpU" title="Sunset over the Applecross Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sunset over the Applecross Hills" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8415/8814542570_32d639b3b7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 2, Sunday 12th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp on Carn na h-Onaich to Wild Camp at end of Loch Mullardoch&lt;br&gt;
Distance:  18km (38km total)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: Sguman Conntich (Corbett)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning was a little less inspiring. The cloud was down low, obscuring the higher summits, but at least the blustery wind of the previous evening had died down in the night. I had breakfast and packed up having decided to try descending directly from the hill to Killilan rather than following my planned route north down to the River Ling and then cutting back south to the village. The weather forecast informed me that a promising morning would rapidly deteriorate and I wanted to make the most of this window, leaving the end of the day for an easy walk along to the western end of Loch Mullardoch where I planned to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erc93w" title="Cloud over the Killilan Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cloud over the Killilan Hills" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3691/8817723674_7a45034aa7_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The descent was easy enough, simply aiming off the hill for the cluster of buildings at Nonach Lodge. Eventually a path emerged and I followed this to the farm and then down the tarmac road and into Killilan itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erc28E" title="Killilan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Killilan" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/8817700424_5c4c37441b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I stopped to look at the dilapidated public telephone box which I was supposed to use to call Challenge Control (four phone calls are required throughout your Crossing to update them on progress and discuss any major route changes). After wedging myself inside the box and working out the correct combination of actions (lifting the receiver, waggling the cable, pressing the coin return button and so on) I finally got a dial tone and my payment was accepted. Roger Smith at Challenge Control answered the phone and was happy with my plan to try the Corbetts today and then follow my FWA the next day rather than attempting the Affric Munros in the high wind and whiteout conditions that were forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqfxXM" title="Public telephone in Killilan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Public telephone in Killilan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8418/8807072975_a188439616_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqfskH" title="Killilan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Killilan" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8113/8807054063_3d6de88627_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formalities observed, and after a second breakfast, I was climbing out of Killilan following the steep sides of Coire Mòr. Above me Ben Killilan rose to the left and the craggy slopes of Sguman Conntich to the right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erbB9u" title="Ascent of Sguman Coinntich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ascent of Sguman Coinntich" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8265/8817619736_6db75e436a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while spent following the landrover track I crossed the stream and ascended the Corbett by a number of ridges and crags until I finally emerged on the summit ridge itself. Behind me the view down Loch Long opened out and eventually I was treated to a panoramic view that took in Knoydart, Loch Duich, Skye and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erbn5j" title="Looking down to Loch Long by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down to Loch Long" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8408/8817572398_ab11c76775_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erbin9" title="Mullardoch Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mullardoch Hills" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7457/8817559918_1ddf683e4e_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqeV4z" title="Summit of Sguman Coinntich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Sguman Coinntich" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3685/8806948843_daa083214d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the views had developed nicely it was clear that rain was approaching. From the summit the hills of Mullardoch and Affric looked magnificent, their coires and ridges picked out by threads of snow. I was quite pleased, however, that there seemed to be much less of the white stuff around than some people had been implying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqeLxe" title="Towards Skye by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Skye" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7387/8806920171_5daa9396a0_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch on the summit and making my way towards the neighbouring Corbett of Faochaig the weather caught up with me. The cloud base dropped rapidly and soon everything was shrouded in mist down to about 750m. After wandering along the impressive scarpment high above Coire Schlat I decided to take a shortcut down to Glen Elchaig rather than trudging up to the summit of Faochaig in clag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqe2kr" title="Faochaig by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Faochaig" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8262/8806774835_7bf1d45a29_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The descent path through the coire of the Allt Domhain to Carnach was excellent with a couple of airy moments high above the tumbling waters of the burn. Down in the glen there was an unusual collection of cows, calves and deer but they moved away as I strode through, making my way along to Iron Lodge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rain came on and off as I moved westward and waterproofs stayed firmly zipped up. The climb up from Iron Lodge towards Mullardoch was on an easy track and at the top just short of Loch an Droma I found a perfect wild camping spot; a grassy bowl sheltered from the wind with a stream coursing through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still early though so I pressed on to my planned spot at the end of Loch Mullardoch. Everything was very, very boggy and the burns were high but plenty of small vehicle bridges made light work of these and soon enough I was dropping down to the Gobh-alltan and getting the tent pitched up in a stiffening westerly breeze just as the rain turned to snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqdT1e" title="Snow showers over the Affric Munros by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Snow showers over the Affric Munros" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2876/8806746809_7102c5e5f9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thereafter it was an evening largely confined to the tent as successive weather fronts blew through. There was rain, snow, hail and wind but I was cosy and warm in my sleeping bag and after a few chapters of my book I drifted off to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 3, Monday 13th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp at end of Loch Mullardoch to Wild Camp in Gleann na Ciche  &lt;br&gt;
Distance:  16km (54km total)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today should have been the first day of Munro bagging, climbing amongst the high hills of Western Affric, but sadly it was not to be. After a final flurry the air was clear by early morning and I was greeted by fresh snow down to 600m and a very strong wind. I quickly decided that the long stretches of ridge walking I had planned would be incredibly difficult in these conditions and as I’d agreed with Roger the day before in Killilan I set out to take my FWA over to Glen Affric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between rain showers I packed up and got on my way, following the track along the southern shore of Loch Mullardoch to the point where it dips down and fords the Abhain Coilich. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erAbQf" title="Gobh-alltan near Loch Mullardoch by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gobh-alltan near Loch Mullardoch" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8261/8822220630_5f76ae2af5_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As another shower cleared I got glorious views of the Mullardoch Munros, snow capped across the glittering waters of the loch. The crossing of the Choilich was relatively straightforward despite a swift current and then I was following the path into a truly magnificent cathedral of mountain scenery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="View back to Mullardoch" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-phAFJ9vQTE8/UaJpN765weI/AAAAAAAAB8Q/oVym3adPC64/w820-h615-no/IMG_20130513_094033.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Affric peaks emerged around the corner of the glen one by one: Carn Eige, Mam Sodhail, An Socach and finally at the far end appeared Sgurr nan Ceathramhnan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqDssZ" title="Head of Gleann a' Choilich by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Head of Gleann a' Choilich" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7397/8811542061_ecba4bfc5b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an utterly glorious sight to behold and although the mountains would disappear from time to time behind fierce billows of snow which were racing down the glen towards me, the sun would return again and blue sky would crackle over the white mountains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqD2op" title="Summit of Sgurr nan Ceathramhnan by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Summit of Sgurr nan Ceathramhnan" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5469/8811457695_f7d971d070_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made steady progress up the glen and then followed the distinct path as it climbed to the bealach between Mam Sodhail and An Socach, the lowest point on this magnificent ridge. As I climbed I found myself amongst fresh snow that deepened as I neared the summit. Emerging on the crest I was greeted with stunning views down across Glen Affric to the Glen Clunie hills and westward to Beinn Fhada. In a convenient wind shelter I stopped for lunch watching as the clouds raced through, their shadows a patchwork of shades on the glen floor below me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erzcBC" title="Looking towards Glen Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking towards Glen Affric" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/8822028150_baf8156f91_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the midday sun the new snow was starting to melt and the south side of the bealach was rather watery, the path playing host to torrents of meltwater. I slithered my way down to drier ground, continuing to admire the views as the cliffs below An Socach emerged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was only as I got lower that the weather once again changed and this time deteriorated with low cloud and high winds taking over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqCqC6" title="The hills of Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills of Affric" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3754/8811340749_01bf33c777_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glen Affric should have felt relatively sheltered but down by the river I found the westerly winds very bad indeed. I scouted around the first flat area I came to and even tried a test pitch but the wind would snatch the tent away from me before I could hook in the first guy point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqCkKk" title="Looking across the River Affric to Beinn Fhada by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking across the River Affric to Beinn Fhada" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3763/8811324349_aea709fe27_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put off by this experience I had a second lunch and then meandered down the glen, thinking it might be more sheltered near Loch Affric. Unfortunately, after passing the buildings at Athnamulloch and coming across the first people I had seen since the main road near Gleann Udalain, I found that the west end of the loch was boggy and exposed. Another perambulation and I was on the track returning back past Athnamulloch and this time branched off into Gleann na Ciche. This glen runs southwest into the heart of the Clunie Munros and proved to be a very &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; bit more sheltered. After covering some distance into the glen I came across a flat area by the stream and decided to try pitching again. This time the tent went up fine and I dived in just as the &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; heavy rain started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqCbYF" title="Wild Camping in Gleann na Ciche by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wild Camping in Gleann na Ciche" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7336/8811294847_efa8da4c5c_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evening proved to be quite wild with ferocious gusts of wind tearing down the glen, bringing with them heavy squalls of rain. Each time the tent would buckle under the force but it held firm. As a murky darkness fell the weather seemed to worsen briefly and a tent peg pinged out. I couldn’t find it in the gloom but a spare one was put in its place and after dumping a pile of river rocks on each pegging point I returned to bed, finally falling asleep as the storm continued to rage all around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 4, Tuesday 14th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp in Gleann na Ciche to Wild Camp above Coire Doe    &lt;br&gt;
Distance:  21km (75km total)  &lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning seemed to be a bit calmer. There was a fresh wind and sunshine over the mountains. I stumbled down to the river to wash my face and it was then that I made the gruesome discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erXVAq" title="Early morning in Gleann na Ciche by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Early morning in Gleann na Ciche" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/8826461832_f1cab75882_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the bank was the distorted corpse of a Jelly Baby, its head ominously missing. Looking back I noticed a trail of similarly mangled Jelly Babies leading back to my tent. I went back around to the cooking porch and found a neat pile of rubber and a series of bite marks in my pot handles. Looking back into the tent I dug out my food bag and found the holes in the tent inner where the creature had bitten though first tent, then plastic bag, then sandwich bag to finally reach, steal and devour my stash of Jelly Babies! There was no sign of the culprit and I hastily took stock of my food, noticing that only the sweets, plus a nibble of peppered salami were missing. The cheese was still there. No conforming to stereotype for the rodents of Glen Affric!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this excitement over (and some duct tape covering the series of little holes in my tent inner) I packed up, fully intending to make the most of the sunshine. I finally found the missing tent peg, twenty metres away and on the opposite side of the tent from where it started! The forecast (though this was a couple of days old by now) had been for more wind and showers and with the Munro tops immediately above my campsite still shrouded in snowy clouds I decided to spend another day going around them, rather than over. In fact I decided to do a variation of my Foul Weather Route to ensure I had a sheltered camp that night across the hills in Coire Doe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erXJxf" title="Glen Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Affric" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3799/8826424644_ee24443e74_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/er2qEP" title="Glen Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Affric" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7390/8815828483_ec3fe62a1d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I retraced my steps down to Athnamulloch in Glen Affric and then continued east, taking the high track that parallels the loch on its southern bank. As a final rain shower cleared from the hills a stunning vista was revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erXEfw" title="Showers in West Glen Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers in West Glen Affric" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7304/8826410218_2821b61d58_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erXxef" title="Mountains of Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mountains of Affric" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5453/8826386596_f29525b97b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big hills on the north of the glen had a pristine covering of snow and the skies above were again blue. I strolled along, taking the odd picture, pausing now and again to just stop and enjoy this glorious morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erXuoj" title="A pause in Glen Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="A pause in Glen Affric" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8419/8826377030_18c4809512_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/er28SV" title="Glen Affric Track by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Glen Affric Track" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5332/8815771997_507ff21e98_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the bridge over the raging Garbh Allt I paused to take off a few layers and eat some food before following the muddy track up beside the tumbling stream. Swollen by rain and snowmelt the current was ferocious, raging down over falls and breaking its banks in several places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/er1WYK" title="The Garbh Allt by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Garbh Allt" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5464/8815735331_ba144d059f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/er21gM" title="The Garbh Allt by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Garbh Allt" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7418/8815746411_72fc6a53c6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the path led me away from the Garbh Allt and up to a point where I joined a landrover track (marked by a Scotways sign) running towards Cougie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqPmFH" title="Looking down the Allt Garbh to Affric by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking down the Allt Garbh to Affric" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3765/8813473735_7d01c022f8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erKz2s" title="Track to Cougie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Track to Cougie" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3802/8824051296_6cfc969094_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through some further smaller showers I made my way across this high, quiet moorland passing through forestry and old growth trees with open views across Loch Beinn a’ Mheadhoinn and east towards the Great Glen. I arrived at the small hamlet of Cougie in yet another shower but it quickly brightened up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqPbDr" title="Towards Creag Dubh and Cougie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Creag Dubh and Cougie" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5326/8813439963_73f38bb698_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Cougie all was quiet as I sat on a rock eating lunch before heading up the wide glen containing the Allt Riabhach. After food I took a good track heading southwest, yet another old right of way across the hills leading to Ceannacroc. This allowed easy progress and I was soon enough heading up towards the bealach that led to a wide stretch of moorland passing below Creag Dubh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqNWha" title="Looking northwest from Cougie by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Looking northwest from Cougie" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8138/8813391633_5b1b19e4dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paused on the summit of the bealach to gaze out over rolling heather to the hills south of Glen Moriston, the last range before the Great Glen. The end of the first stage of the Crossing was now close at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqNDve" title="Meallan Odhar by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Meallan Odhar" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2848/8813335203_9f77b492dd_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find shelter I dropped down into Coire Doe, leaving the track and following a delightful little stream that descended between steep banks where an occasional twisted tree grew and there were idyllic patches of flat, close-cropped grass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/erJBKd" title="Walking across the moor by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking across the moor" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/8823865334_b962fc0255_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually selected one of these as my pitch for the night, the high banks providing shelter from the wind whilst the elevation gave excellent views across to the mountains of Coire Doe, just emerging from the last of the heavy showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eqN1Pz" title="Camped above Coire Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camped above Coire Doe" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/8813211799_23d5096ef6_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the tent up I was able to attend to tent repairs in a more relaxed manner and then spent a perfect evening, the first one where I had warmth enough to sit outside for a spell eating my dinner. There was even a touch of mobile signal allowing me to send off the first photo from the trip. I happily watched the sun sink into the cloud sitting over the mountains and then headed to bed, feeling great after a final good day in the North West Highlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 5, Wednesday 15th May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: Wild Camp above Coire Doe to B&amp;amp;B in Fort Augustus&lt;br&gt;
Distance:  30km (105km total)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day dawned as brightly as it had ended the previous evening. As I lay in my sleeping bag the sun crested the hill behind me and I was bathed in warmth. Would this be the first time since leaving Plockton that I hadn’t started a day in waterproofs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etsfih" title="Coire Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Doe" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3687/8843304386_f1cf424bcf_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etoHnZ" title="Camping above Coire Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Camping above Coire Doe" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/8842615039_43dbfb49a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a leisurely breakfast I did indeed set off in minimal layers, suitable for the rapidly warming day. I had a bit of a map ponder and then dropped down from my camp spot to the River Doe which was wide but docile. I waded this easily and picked up the landrover track on the far side, following it eastward as it wound away from the hills and down towards the relative civilisation of Glen Moriston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etrCZy" title="Coire Doe Hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coire Doe Hills" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7356/8843185618_b74886253a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eto2hB" title="River Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Doe" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8419/8842480167_144c2a893b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etnUkv" title="The River Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The River Doe" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8258/8842456787_2d4933cafb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of hydro developments along this stretch and I used the access infrastructure to cross the river and then loop around via some higher ground to reach the end of a white road at the farm of Tomchrasky. On the way I spotted my first ever Black Grouse and had to briefly put on the waterproofs as an errant shower passed through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etqM9w" title="Bend in the River Doe by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bend in the River Doe" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5456/8843017938_82b5cdeb3a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etq4fs" title="The hills beyond Glen Moriston by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The hills beyond Glen Moriston" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8408/8842876994_5482b22e7a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etmJBB" title="Clouds over mountains by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Clouds over mountains" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/8842228969_d580fa6056_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etmAjZ" title="The winding road above Glen Moriston by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The winding road above Glen Moriston" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3670/8842201093_c95747ef5a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 5km of road walking I put on my headphones and got my head down, pausing once because of a little moment with a bull/large cow that got panicked as its calves ran off into the wood through an open gate, and then again to talk to an elderly gentleman walking his dog - my first human contact since lunch in Plockton! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etpxkf" title="Showers in the hills by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Showers in the hills" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/8842776352_670bba4530_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etporY" title="The farm road to Torgyle Bridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The farm road to Torgyle Bridge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3811/8842746466_9c172cca42_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road eventually led through the strung out village of Dalchreichart and emerged at the main A 887 road at Torgyle Bridge which I used to cross the River Moriston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etpk37" title="Torgyle Bridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Torgyle Bridge" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3813/8842734990_96d6b1c29d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After following a grassy track for a short distance I crossed the main road and took a track signed to Fort Augustus by the Old Drove Road. I took the opportunity to use a picnic table at the track entrance to enjoy an early lunch and air the feet after the road walk. After lunch I continued, soon having to pass through a gate which marked the start of the Beauly-Denny power line upgrade construction area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etm3YD" title="Old Drove Road to Fort Augustus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old Drove Road to Fort Augustus" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3717/8842095629_b98f84231a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track wound its way upwards through the woods with occasional breaks in the tree cover to give views westward down Glen Moriston. I reached the continuation of the Old Military Road and followed this much more pleasant track back east through the top of the woods until it eventually rejoined the construction road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etoWuS" title="Old Military Road to Fort Augustus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old Military Road to Fort Augustus" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/8842659170_77b4c43596_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etkBg4" title="Walking above Glen Moriston by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Walking above Glen Moriston" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8842009117_bd888fb79a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next stretch was a little dispiriting with the new power lines causing a great big mess. I got through it as quickly as possible but was heartened to at least get friendly nods from the drivers of the various vans and trucks which were labouring up and down the gravelly roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etkwxg" title="The Beauly-Denny Upgrade by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Beauly-Denny Upgrade" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3721/8841993237_5bf3356d0f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etkrC6" title="Forestry Road by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Forestry Road" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5466/8841976697_911139fe32_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally I crested the hill and started the descent to Fort Augustus leaving the construction road to take a delightful track down a bunch of winding, grassy zig-zags to eventually reach the outskirts of the village which sits in the heart of the Great Glen at the southern end of Loch Ness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etk24B" title="Descent to Fort Augustus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Descent to Fort Augustus" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8411/8841894077_3ed09a9f7d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some final food by a quiet pool I braced myself for the return to civilisation. Strolling down into the village I was met by an array of tourist coaches and aimlessly wandering crowds, dotted with the odd Great Glen Way walker or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/etjTMH" title="Caledonian Canal, Fort Augustus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Caledonian Canal, Fort Augustus" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7350/8841869607_16851e3694_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a Bed and Breakfast booked for the night but before that had to do my first re-supply. Even before that though I got myself a helping of fish and chips and wandered down to the south end of Loch Ness to enjoy a carborific lunch with superb views. I phoned Challenge Control and reported that I was on track and looking forward to heading into the Monadhliath. The stormy weather seemed to finally be done with and it was set to be much finer over the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eto1MU" title="Loch Ness by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Loch Ness" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5452/8842478502_dd15f51631_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The petrol station supermarket proved to carry everything I needed (except for hot chocolate sachets and couscous for which I had to make interesting substitutions) and with my sack feeling heavy once again I followed the Great Glen Way north to the edge of the village where I found the &lt;a href="http://three-bridges.co.uk/"&gt;Three Bridges Bed &amp;amp; Breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. Here I was welcomed in with a comfy en-suite single room and a cup of tea (with real milk and several slices of cake - wonderful). Here I was able to unpack all my gear and do some washing and in the evening headed into the village for a pub dinner at The Bothy where I got chatting to a guy visiting from Stuttgart who was doing a coast to coast himself, only by mountain bike in his case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the hostel I phoned home and then had a second rather decadent hot shower before getting in between clean sheets and sinking into a deep sleep. Four nights of wild camping had brought me through the North West Highlands in one piece and now that the weather was feeling milder I was ready to start bagging some tops!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="scotland"></category><category term="tgoc"></category><category term="tgo challenge"></category><category term="tgo challenge 2013"></category><category term="north west highlands"></category><category term="report"></category><category term="trip"></category><category term="backpacking"></category><category term="hiking"></category><category term="wild camping"></category></entry><entry><title>TGO Challenge 2013 : Part 4</title><link href="https://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-4/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-23T20:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2013-05-23T20:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nick Bramhall</name></author><id>tag:tms.nickbramhall.com,2013-05-23:/blog/2013/05/tgoc-part-4/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In May 2013 I backpacked across Scotland.

&lt;p&gt;This is Part 4 of my TGO Challenge 2013 which picks up the story on Day 13 after a final overnight stay at North Water Bridge campsite, just a few miles from the east coast. If you missed them you can catch up on the previous parts as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Day 13, Thursday 23rd May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: North Water Bridge to St Cyrus&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 13km (Total 322km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly the 230g gas canister I set out with lasted up until coffee on the final morning. I had bought a 110g canister in Aviemore but it had sat unused in my pack until now. In retrospect I could have missed out on the final brew but as it was I fired up the stove on fresh fuel and enjoyed my final dose of caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 13, Thursday 23rd May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route: North Water Bridge to St Cyrus&lt;br&gt;
Distance: 13km (Total 322km)&lt;br&gt;
Hills: None&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly the 230g gas canister I set out with lasted up until coffee on the final morning. I had bought a 110g canister in Aviemore but it had sat unused in my pack until now. In retrospect I could have missed out on the final brew but as it was I fired up the stove on fresh fuel and enjoyed my final dose of caffeine. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once I unzipped the tent I found that people were in various states of packing away, most in waterproofs as the occasional drizzly shower drifted through. I made a slow start and packed everything up inside the tent. By the time I emerged the rain had mostly stopped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the shower block I met Bob Cartwright from &lt;a href="http://www.backpackinglight.co.uk/"&gt;Backpackinglight.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.theoutdoorsstation.co.uk/"&gt;Outdoors Station&lt;/a&gt; and had a brief chat with him before setting off from the campsite at around 8:30am. The day now promised to be a good one with sunshine and a stiff breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDYDhR" title="River North Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River North Esk" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3772/8962400053_c28d63cebb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed a group of Challengers along the road and crossed the fairly quiet A90 to reach a minor road heading east towards Hillside. At the last minute I had changed my plan to get to the coast and rather than take the more direct route to St Cyrus I chose to make my way down to a point where the Aberdeenshire Coastal Path could be joined for a run north along the coast to the beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE5Ffq" title="Rainbow over the fields by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rainbow over the fields" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7376/8963577312_2b9793d443_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involved plodding along the Hillside road for a while, enjoying the sunshine over the fields and the odd rainbow, until I spotted a side track that led me between fields and woodlands and then down another track into a back road of Hillside near the pleasant estate of Rosemount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE5C5m" title="A shortcut to Hillside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="A shortcut to Hillside" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7456/8963566636_be58bb0f93_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavements were followed through Hillside and then it was along (what I thought to be) the coastal route, past the maltings plant and then to the junction with the A95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE5xjd" title="Coast road at Hillside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Coast road at Hillside" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/8963550620_a5d558c99a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDYkE6" title="Malting Plan at Hillside by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Malting Plan at Hillside" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3695/8962340733_39318864f3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was parallel with an old railway line and thankfully after a short way beside the main road I was able to join this as it crossed the River North Esk via an impressive high level bridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDYihX" title="Old Railway Bridge by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Old Railway Bridge" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5467/8962332779_a3c7bc9990_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDYdSH" title="River North Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River North Esk" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5348/8962317917_17268e44d8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE5jth" title="River North Esk by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="River North Esk" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7395/8963507414_d09ac5449d_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was now on National Cycle Route 1 and followed this as it descended steeply to a farm road running beside the river. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE5ghJ" title="National Cycle Route 1 by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="National Cycle Route 1" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8404/8963496710_bec9535d96_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed this along the marshy flats near the estuary passing by various farms and B&amp;amp;Bs and saying hello to a Challenger who was making her way on foot back to Montrose having finished north of St Cyrus the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the visitor centre for the Natural Nature Reserve at St Cyrus came into view and I followed a small waymarked path that led to a boardwalk across a boggy area and then up to the dunes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDY51P" title="St Cyrus Nature Reserve by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="St Cyrus Nature Reserve" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7355/8962288111_844f23e9c8_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE58Ub" title="Boardwalk at St Cyrus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Boardwalk at St Cyrus" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8533/8963471854_ca1af716e3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disadvantage of this route was that the sea was largely kept hidden from me but it was with a final joyful step that I crested the dunes and finally gazed out over a sparkling blue North Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE55sm" title="Path the beach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Path the beach" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/8963460264_10500368f4_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDXQnR" title="Dunes at St Cyrus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dunes at St Cyrus" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8277/8962242235_2aa79ddd1b_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDXMhP" title="The North Sea by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The North Sea" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3723/8962231851_4b5f94d7c3_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beautiful piles of clouds stood above the water and the pale sand stretched away in either direction. I took the last steps of my Crossing until the first lapping waves of the North Sea touched my feet. It was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDXHYk" title="The East Coast by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="The East Coast" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3769/8962220687_9d6ec1647f_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still some heavy showers around and one of these had just passed over St Cyrus and was rumbling out to sea. I returned to the dry beach and took a few photos. Then I sat down, gazing out at the sea and thinking back on all the incredible experiences I had enjoyed over the previous twelve and a half days. That Saturday lunchtime in Plockton felt a long time ago, and a long way away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDXuvx" title="Journey's End by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Journey's End" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3787/8962175401_77cb0a1b39_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I called home and shared the good news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE4ALh" title="On the beach by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="On the beach" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3770/8963367112_0ecaa75aeb_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With another dark cloud moving in I gathered my things and set off down the beach to find the cliff path up to St Cyrus. A couple arrived just after me and in amongst the wind and rain I just about managed to take their picture for them. By the time I arrived at the feet of the cliffs it was warm and sunny again. This Challenge weather certainly wasn’t going to let up! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eE459h" title="St Cyrus by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="St Cyrus" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2855/8963264104_c8777b40a9_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliff climb was steep but the views were outstanding as I gained a bit of height. You could see down the wide sweep of coast line beyond the North Esk estuary to Montrose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eDWQWV" title="Towards Montrose by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="Towards Montrose" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5466/8962049041_b2da357a1a_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the north the cliffs swept around to a craggy headland. I chatted with a few folk as the area was busy with Challengers going to and from the beach and then headed through the village to the bus stop, arriving just in time to catch the 11:52 into Montrose. In Montrose it was just a short walk from the high street along to the Park Hotel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately I spotted &lt;a href="http://www.summitandvalley.com/"&gt;Martin Rye&lt;/a&gt; sitting with a few folk, including &lt;a href="http://aktovate1.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Gordon Green&lt;/a&gt;. I headed upstairs to officially complete the Challenge, enjoying a chat with John Manning and collecting my assorted goodies. Upstairs it was very convivial and I was plied with tea and biscuits and chatted to a few folk, including Nicole from Inverness, whose &lt;a href="http://ness64.wordpress.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; I am a big fan of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back downstairs I sat and chatted with Martin and &lt;a href="http://sectionhiker.com/"&gt;Philip Werner&lt;/a&gt; and there was a brief period when &lt;a href="http://northernpies.blogspot.co.uk/"&gt;Mike Knipe&lt;/a&gt; stopped by to share some of his tales. Alan Sloman and crew arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, after enjoying chatting with people previously only known through blogs and Twitter, and as people started to disperse for lunch, I headed along to the train station to finally close the loop. It was just a short wait on a windswept platform before I was heading back up to Aberdeen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Montrose Basin" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ks45c_g-htM/UaJpN9rkPzI/AAAAAAAAB5w/Vb4OIDX0POg/w791-h593-no/IMG_20130523_140732.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived back, managed to grab a taxi straightaway and was home and in a hot shower. A couple of hours later I had a beer and a jumbo sized portion of fish and chips to celebrate. The TGO Challenge was complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://flic.kr/p/eN7kCP" title="TGO Challenge End I by Nick Bramhall, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img alt="TGO Challenge End I" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2867/9054433523_e807a91679_b.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brief Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed almost every minute of my 2013 TGO Challenge. There were certainly a couple of low points but each time I rallied myself and got on with it. Having a very simple focus for each day was a wonderful, liberating experience and having a good plan with sensible alternatives for foul weather made it possible to make progress without invoking a lot of stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the experience of moving through a landscape, watching as mountains came and passed by, receding into the background to be replaced by yet more mountains ahead. It was addictive and gave me another level of appreciation for the jigsaw puzzle that is the Highlands. A few more pieces now fit together in my head. My horizons have been broadened and there are new places I would love to return to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the weather was less than brilliant, especially in the first week when it was a slight disappointment not to get up onto the Munros as planned, it was never beyond my kit or capabilities and I never had any problems with being too wet or too cold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Recover II" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vP7k4wIp4UY/UaJpN1sOZuI/AAAAAAAAB5s/VC_6aSnEWsY/w732-h549-no/IMG_20130524_120118.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleased that I was able to feed myself without resorting to food parcels and though I had a hearty appetite when I returned I think I maintained a good calorie intake through the trip. My gear functioned very well and the couple of failures I experienced were minor and largely due to unavoidable outside influences. Socks were my biggest problem. I'll do a separate post on gear thoughts at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would I do the Challenge again? Absolutely! Though it will probably be a few years until I return (I'd like to do long distance walks in other places beyond the UK) I will definitely be back for another Crossing in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less than a week I’ll be setting off from Plockton on &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/04/tgoc-route/"&gt;my TGO Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Gear is of course a very personal thing and what I’ll be taking with me has, in most cases, proved itself over several trips over the last couple of years. There are a couple of new items but these got a reasonable &lt;a href="http://tms.nickbramhall.com/blog/2013/05/ardgour-adventure/"&gt;outing in Ardgour last weekend&lt;/a&gt; and I’m confident that they’ll suit my needs. I was aiming for a baseweight of 8kg but have slightly overshot, mainly because of the addition of a pair of microspikes to deal with whatever remains of winter in the high mountains. This also details food required for the first stretch which is 4.5 days of walking to get me to Fort Augustus. Subsequent sections are shorter but I’ll be carrying store bought foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Weight: 8.68kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base Weight is the weight of everything carried (in a pack or about your person such as in a camera bag). It excludes consumables (see below) and clothing worn (see the first category above). I also exclude walking poles since these are in my hands 95% of the time when walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Consumables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gas: 0.23kg  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water: 0.5kg  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food (5 days to Fort Augustus): 2.93kg  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Pack Weight: 12.33kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin-Out Weight: 14.85kg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
